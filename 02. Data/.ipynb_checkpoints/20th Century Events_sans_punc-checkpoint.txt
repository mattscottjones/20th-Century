creation of atomic bombs  the Cold War led to the Space Race and the creation of space based rockets  and the World Wide Web was created  These advancements have played a significant role in citizens  lives and shaped the   st century into what it is today Historic events in the   th century edit The world at the beginning of the century edit Main article  Edwardian eraThe new beginning of the   th century marked significant changes  The     s saw the decade herald a series of inventions  including the automobile  airplane and radio broadcasting From      to       the First World War  and its aftermath  caused major changes in the power balance of the world  destroying or transforming some of the most powerful empires  The war to end all wars   World War I             edit Main article  World War IArrest of a suspect in Sarajevo following the Assassination of Archduke Franz FerdinandThe First World War  or simply WWI   termed  The Great War  by contemporaries  started in      and ended in       The war and by extension the century as a whole was ignited by the Assassination in Sarajevo of the Austro Hungarian Empire s heir to the throne  Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand  by Gavrilo Princip of the organization  Young Bosnia   Bosnian Serbs  liberation movement  This was similar to how the      was the inciting incident of the   st century     Bound by Slavic nationalism to help the small Serbian state  the Russians came to the aid of the Serbs when they were attacked  Interwoven alliances  an increasing arms race  and old hatreds dragged Europe into the war     The Allies  known initially as  The Triple Entente   comprised the British Empire  France  and Russia  Germany  Austria Hungary  Bulgaria  and later the Ottoman Empire  were known as  The Central Powers        In       Russia ended hostile actions against the Central Powers after the fall of the Tsar  The Bolsheviks negotiated the Treaty of Brest Litovsk with Germany  although it was a huge cost to Russia  In the treaty  Bolshevik Russia ceded the Baltic states to Germany  and its province of Kars Oblast in the South Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire  It also recognized the independence of Ukraine     Although Germany shifted huge forces from the eastern to the western front after signing the treaty  it was unable to stop the Allied advance  especially with the entrance of American troops in         The war itself was also a chance for the combatant nations to show off their military strength and technological ingenuity  The Germans introduced the machine gun     U boats    and deadly gases     The British first used the tank      Both sides had a chance to test out their new aircraft to see if they could be used in warfare  It was widely believed that the war would be short  Unfortunately  since trench warfare was the best form of defense  advances on both sides were very slow and came at a terrible cost to lives     Division of Austria Hungary after World War IWhen the war was finally over in       the results would set the stage for the next twenty years  First and foremost  the Germans were forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles  forcing them to make exorbitant payments to repair damages caused during the War  Many Germans felt these reparations were unfair because they did not actually  lose  the war nor did they feel they caused the war  see Stab in the back legend       Germany was never occupied by Allied troops  yet it had to accept a liberal democratic government imposed on it by the victors after the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm     Much of the map of Europe was redrawn by the victors based upon the theory that future wars could be prevented if all ethnic groups had their own  homeland    New states like Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were created out of the former Austro Hungarian Empire to accommodate the nationalist aspirations of these groups       An international body called the League of Nations was formed to mediate disputes and prevent future wars  although its effectiveness was severely limited by  among other things  its reluctance and inability to act     The Russian Revolution and Communism edit Main article  Russian RevolutionThe Russian Revolution of       ending in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the execution of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II and his family  sparked a wave of communist revolutions across Europe  prompting many to believe that a socialist world revolution could be realized in the near future      However  the European revolutions were defeated  Vladimir Lenin died in       and within a few years  Joseph Stalin displaced Leon Trotsky as the de facto leader of the Soviet Union  The idea of worldwide revolution was no longer in the forefront  as Stalin concentrated on  socialism in one country      and embarked on a bold plan of collectivization and industrialization      The majority of socialists and even many communists became disillusioned with Stalin s autocratic rule  his purges and the assassination of his  enemies   as well as the news of famines he imposed on his own people     Communism was strengthened as a force in Western democracies when the global economy crashed in      in what became known as the Great Depression  Many people saw this as the first stage of the end of the capitalist system and were attracted to Communism as a solution to the economic crisis  especially as the Soviet Union s economic development in the     s was strong  unaffected by the capitalist world s crisis     Between the wars edit Dorothea Lange s      photo Migrant Mother is one of the most iconic photos associated with the Great DepressionMain article  Interwar periodEconomic depression edit Main articles  Roaring Twenties and Great DepressionAfter World War I  the global economy remained strong through most of the     s  The war had provided a stimulus for industry and economic activity in general  There were many warning signs foretelling the Crash of    of the global economic system at the end of the decade  that were generally not understood by the political leadership of the time      The responses to the crisis often made the situation worse  as millions of people watched their savings become next to worthless  and the idea of a steady job with a reasonable income fading away     Many sought answers from alternative ideologies such as communism and fascism      They believed that the capitalist economic system was collapsing and that new ideas were required to meet the crisis  The early responses to the crisis were based on the assumption that the free market would correct itself  This  however  did very little to correct the crisis or to alleviate the suffering of many ordinary people  Thus  the idea that the existing system could be reformed by government intervention in the economy  rather than by continuing the laissez faire approach  became prominent as a solution to the crisis  Democratic governments assumed the responsibility to provide needed services in society  and to alleviate poverty  Thus was born the welfare state      These two politico economic principles  the belief in government intervention and the welfare state  as opposed to the belief in the free market and private institutions  would define many political battles for the rest of the century The rise of dictatorship edit Main articles  Fascism  Totalitarianism  and DictatorshipNazi soldiers hang a poster on the window of Jewish owned business  that says   Germans  defend yourselves  Do not buy from Jews   Germany      Fascism first appeared in Italy with the rise to power of Benito Mussolini in           The ideology was supported by a large proportion of the upper classes as a strong challenge to the threat of communism     When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in       a new variant of fascism called Nazism took over Germany and ended the German experiment with democracy  The Nazi Party in Germany was dedicated to the restoration of German honor and prestige  the unification of German speaking peoples  and the annexation of Central and Eastern Europe as vassal states  with the Slavic population to act as slave labor to serve German economic interests       There was also a strong appeal to a mythical racial purity  the idea that Germans were the Herrenvolk or the  master race    and a vicious antisemitism which promoted the idea of Jews as subhuman  Untermensch  and worthy only of extermination     Many people in Western Europe and the United States greeted the rise of Hitler with relief or indifference      They could see nothing wrong with a strong Germany ready to take on the communist menace to the east  Antisemitism during the Great Depression was widespread as many were content to blame the Jews for causing the economic downturn     Hitler began to put his plan in motion  annexing Austria in the Anschluss  or reunification of Austria to Germany  in           He then negotiated the annexation of the Sudetenland  a German speaking mountainous area of Czechoslovakia  in the Munich Conference      The British were eager to avoid war and believed Hitler s assurance to protect the security of the Czech state   Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech state shortly afterwards  indicating that he had ulterior motives     Fascism was not the only form of dictatorship to rise in the post war period   Almost all of the new democracies in the nations of Eastern Europe collapsed and were replaced by authoritarian regimes      Spain also became a dictatorship under the leadership of General Francisco Franco after the Spanish Civil War      Totalitarian states attempted to achieve total control over their subjects as well as their total loyalty  They held the state above the individual  and were often responsible for some of the worst acts in history  such as the Holocaust Adolf Hitler perpetrated on European Jews  or the Great Purge Stalin perpetrated in the Soviet Union in the     s Global war  World War II             edit Main article  World War IIThe war in Europe edit Main article  European Theater of World War IIThis section provides a conversational overview of World War II in Europe  See main article for a fuller discussion The signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact in Moscow  August         Soon after the events in Czechoslovakia  Britain and France issued assurances of protection to Poland  which seemed to be next on Hitler s list  World War II officially began on September          when Hitler unleashed his Blitzkrieg  or lightning war  against Poland  Britain and France  much to Hitler s surprise  immediately declared war upon Germany  but the help they delivered to Poland was negligible      Sixteen days later  Poland was attacked from the East by Soviet Union  acting in a secret alliance with Nazi Germany      After only a few weeks  the Polish forces were overwhelmed  and its government fled to exile in London  see Polish government in Exile  In starting World War II  the Germans had unleashed a new type of warfare  characterized by highly mobile forces and the use of massed aircraft  The German strategy concentrated upon the devotion of the Wehrmacht  or German army  to the use of tank groups  called panzer divisions  and groups of mobile infantry  in concert with relentless attacks from the air  Encirclement was also a major part of the strategy  This change smashed any expectations that the Second World War would be fought in the trenches like the first     As Hitler s forces conquered Poland  the Soviet Union  under General Secretary Joseph Stalin  was acting out guarantees of territory under a secret part of a nonaggression pact between the USSR and Germany known as the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  This treaty gave Stalin free rein to take the Baltic republics of Estonia  Latvia  and Lithuania  as well as Eastern Poland  all of which would remain in Soviet possession after the war      Stalin also launched an attack on Finland  which he hoped to reduce to little more than a Soviet puppet state  but the Red Army met staunch Finnish resistance in what became known as the Winter War and succeeded in gaining only limited territory from the Finns      This action would later cause the Finns to ally with Germany when its attack on the Soviet Union came in          Blitzkrieg edit After the defeat of Poland  a period known as the Phony War ensued during the winter of            which saw only limited military land operation on the Western Front      All of this changed on May           when the Germans launched a massive attack on the Low Countries  Belgium  the Netherlands  and Luxembourg   most probably to surmount the Maginot Line of defenses on the Franco German border      This witnessed the incredible fall of Eben Emael  a Belgian fort considered impregnable and guarded by     Belgians  to a force of only    German paratroopers  The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May    without warning his allies  exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups      Following the conquest of the Low Countries  Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway  beginning on April          Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine  Norway held on for a few crucial weeks  but Denmark surrendered after only six hours          Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war  with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies     With the disaster in the Low Countries  France  considered at the time to have had the finest army in the world  lasted only four weeks  with Paris being occupied on June     Three days later  Marshal Philippe P tain surrendered to the Germans      The debacle in France also led to one of the war s greatest mysteries  and Hitler s first great blunder  Dunkirk  where a third of a million trapped British and French soldiers were evacuated by not only British war boats  but every craft the army could find  including fishing boats  Hitler refused to  risk  his panzers on an action at Dunkirk  listening to the advice of Air Minister Hermann G ring and allowing the Luftwaffe  or German Air Force  to handle the job      The irony of this was that the escaped men would form the core of the army that was to invade the beaches of Normandy in       Hitler did not occupy all of France  but about three quarters  including all of the Atlantic coast  allowing Marshal P tain to remain as dictator of an area known as Vichy France      However  members of the escaped French Army formed around General Charles de Gaulle to create the Free French forces  which would continue to battle Hitler in the stead of an independent France      At this moment  Italy  under Benito Mussolini  declared war on the Allies on June     thinking that the war was almost over  but he managed only to occupy a few hundred yards of French territory      Throughout the war  the Italians would be more of a burden to the Nazis than a boon  and would later cost them precious time in Greece         German Heinkel He     bombers during the Battle of BritainHitler now turned his eyes on Great Britain  which stood alone against him  He ordered his generals to draw up plans for an invasion  code named Operation Sea Lion  and ordered the Luftwaffe to launch a massive air war against the British isles  which would come to be known as the Battle of Britain  The British at first suffered steady losses  but eventually managed to turn the air war against Germany  taking down       German planes throughout the summer of      to only     Royal Air Force  RAF  losses      The key turning point came when the Germans discontinued successful attacks against British airplane factories and radar command and coordination stations and turned to civilian bombing known as terror bombing using the distinctive  bomb  sound created by the German dive bomber  the Stuka      The switch came after a small British bombing force had attacked Berlin      Hitler was infuriated  However  his decision to switch the attacks  focus allowed the British to rebuild the RAF and eventually force the Germans to indefinitely postpone Sea Lion     The importance of the Battle of Britain is that it marked the first of Hitler s defeats  however its overall impact was overshadowed by his later blunders in the east  Secondly  it marked the advent of radar as a major weapon in modern air war   With radar  squadrons of fighters could be quickly assembled to respond to incoming bombers attempting to bomb civilian targets  It also allowed the identification of the type and a guess at the number of incoming enemy aircraft  as well as tracking of friendly airplanes     Operation Barbarossa edit Hitler  taken aback by his defeat over the skies of Britain  now turned his gaze eastward to the Soviet Union  Despite having signed the non aggression pact with Stalin  Hitler despised communism and wished to destroy it in the land of its birth  He originally planned to launch the attack in early spring of      to avoid the disastrous Russian winter  However  a pro allied coup in Yugoslavia and Mussolini s almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupied Albania prompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time      The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts  the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the USSR  potentially hampering it     Europe at the height of German control in     On June           Hitler attacked Stalin with the largest army the world had ever seen  Over three million men and their weapons were put into service against the Soviet Union      Stalin had been warned about the attack  both by other countries and by his own intelligence network  but he had refused to believe it  Therefore  the Soviet army was largely unprepared and suffered massive setbacks in the early part of the war  despite Stalin s orders to counterattack the Germans      Throughout       German forces  divided into   army groups  Army Group A  Army Group B  and Army Group C   occupied the territories of the present day Ukraine and Belarus  laid siege to Leningrad  present day Saint Petersburg   and advanced to within    miles of Moscow  At this critical moment  the Soviet people stalled the German Wehrmacht to a halt at the gates of Moscow  Stalin had planned to evacuate the city  and had already moved important government functions  but decided to stay and rally the city  Recently arrived troops from the east under the command of Marshal Georgy Zhukov counterattacked the Germans and drove them from Moscow     Mussolini had launched an offensive in North Africa from Italian controlled Libya into British controlled Egypt  However  the British smashed the Italians and were on the verge of taking Libya  Hitler decided to help by sending in a few thousand troops  a Luftwaffe division  and the first rate general Erwin Rommel      Rommel managed to use his small force to repeatedly smash massively superior British forces and to recapture the port city of Tobruk and advance into Egypt  However  Hitler  embroiled in his invasion of the Soviet Union  refused to send Rommel any more troops  causing Rommel to retreat and preventing him from seizing the Middle East  where Axis friendly regimes had taken root in Iraq and Persia  present day Iran          After the winter  Hitler launched a fresh offensive in the spring of       with the aim of capturing the oil rich Caucacus and the city of Stalingrad  However  he repeatedly switched his troops to where they were not needed  The offensive bogged down  and the entire  th Army  considered the best of German troops  was trapped in Stalingrad  Hitler now refused to let  th Army break out  He insisted that the German army would force its way in  Hermann G ring also assured Hitler that the Luftwaffe could supply the  th Army adequately  when it could in reality only supply a minute fraction of the needed ammunition and rations  Eventually  the starved  th Army surrendered  dealing a severe blow to the Germans  In the end  the defeat at Stalingrad was the turning point for the war in the east     Meanwhile  the Japanese had attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December          This disastrous attack forced the Americans into the war  Parts of the German brass advised against declaring war on the US  arguing that since Japan was the aggressor  the Tripartite Pact didn t bind Germany to do so  However  Hitler hoped that Japan would be able to quickly defeat the US and then turn its attention on helping the effort against Russia  Both Germany and Italy declared war on the United States a few days after the attack     Turning tides edit A British soldier gives a V gesture to German prisoners captured at El Alamein     October     Throughout the rest of      and       the Soviets began to gain ground against the Germans after some victories like the tank battle of Kursk      By this time  Rommel had been forced to abandon North Africa after a defeat by Montgomery at El Alamein in what was the first decisive victory of the Allies over the Germany army  leading Churchill to declare it  the end of the beginning       On several fronts  the Wehrmacht had encountered serious casualties that it could not replace  Hitler also insisted on a  hold at all costs  policy which forbade relinquishing any ground  He followed a  fight to the last man  policy that was completely ineffective  By the beginning of       Hitler had lost all initiative in the Soviet Union  and was struggling even to hold back the tide turning against him     From      to       the United States and Britain acted in only a limited manner in the European theater  much to the chagrin of Stalin  They drove out the Germans in Africa  invading Morocco and Algeria on November              Then  on July           the Allies invaded Sicily  in preparation for an advance through Italy  the  soft underbelly  of the Axis  as Winston Churchill called it  On September    the invasion of Italy began      By the winter of       the southern half of Italy was in Allied hands  The Italians  most of whom did not really support the war  had already turned against Mussolini  In July  he had been stripped of power and taken prisoner  though the Italians feigned continued support of the Axis  On September    the Italians formally surrendered      but most of Italy not in Allied hands was controlled by German troops and those loyal to Mussolini s  Mussolini had been freed by German paratroopers  new Italian Social Republic  which in reality consisted of the shrinking zone of German control  The Germans offered staunch resistance  but by June          Rome had fallen     The Battle of the Atlantic took place from      to      and was described as  longest  largest  and most complex naval battle in history       The Germans hoped to sever the vital supply lines between Britain and America  sinking many tons of shipping with U boats  German submarines  However  the development of the destroyer and aircraft with a longer patrol range were effective at countering the U boat threat and by December       the Germans had lost the battle     Operation Overlord edit On June          the Western Allies finally launched the long awaited assault on  Fortress Europe  so wanted by Stalin  The offensive  codenamed Operation Overlord  began the early morning hours of June    The day  known as D day  was marked by foul weather   Rommel  who was now in charge of defending France against possible Allied attack  thought the Allies would not attack during the stormy weather  and was on holiday in Germany      Besides this  the Germans were expecting an attack  but at the natural harbor of Calais and not the beaches of Normandy  They did not know about the Allies  artificial harbours  and false leads planted by the Allies suggested Calais as the landing site     United States assault troops approaching Omaha Beach    June      By this time  the war was looking ever darker for Germany  On July           a group of conspiring German officers attempted to assassinate Hitler  The bomb they used did injure him  but the second was not used  and a table shielded Hitler in a stroke of luck      The plotters still could have launched a coup  but only the head of occupied Paris acted  arresting SS and Gestapo forces in the city  The German propaganda minister  Joseph Goebbels  rallied the Nazis and hunted down the conspirators  arresting up to      people in the wake of the plot  according to some estimates     In France  the Allies took Normandy and finally Paris on August         In the east  the Soviets had advanced almost to the former Polish Soviet border  At this time  Hitler introduced the V weapons  the V   flying bomb and  later  the V    the first rockets used in modern warfare  The V   was often intercepted by air pilots  but the V   was extremely fast and carried a large payload  However  this advance came too late in the war to have any real effect      The Germans were also on the verge of introducing a number of terrifying new weapons  including advanced jet aircraft  which were too fast for ordinary propeller aircraft  and submarine improvements which would allow the Germans to again fight effectively in the Atlantic  All this came too late to save Hitler  Although a September invasion of The Netherlands failed  the Allies made steady advances  In the winter of       Hitler put everything into one last desperate gamble in the West  known as the Battle of the Bulge  which  despite an initial advance  was a failure  because the introduction of new Allied tanks and low troop numbers among the Germans prevented any real action being taken  Nevertheless  it was one of the bloodiest battles of the war and the second costliest battle in the history of the American Army     Final days edit In early February       the three Allied leaders  Franklin Roosevelt  Winston Churchill  and Joseph Stalin  met at newly liberated Yalta in the Crimea in the Soviet Union in the Yalta Conference      Here  they agreed upon a plan to divide post war Europe  Most of the east went to Stalin  who agreed to allow free elections in Eastern Europe  which he never did  The west went to Britain  France  and the United States Post war Germany would be split between the four  as would Berlin  This division of spheres of influence would set up international diplomacy for the Cold War that would dominate the second half of the century     At the beginning of       Hitler was on his last strings  The Soviets launched a devastating attack from Poland into Germany and Eastern Europe  intending to take Berlin  The Germans collapsed in the West  allowing the Allies to fan out across Germany  However  the Supreme Allied Commander  American general Dwight D  Eisenhower  refused to strike for Berlin  and instead became obsessed with reports of possible guerrilla activity in southern Germany  which in reality existed mainly in the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels      By April     the Soviets had besieged Berlin  Hitler remained in the city in a bunker under the Chancellery garden  On April     he committed suicide by shooting himself  after a ritual wedding with his longtime mistress Eva Braun      The Germans held out another   days under Admiral Doenitz  their new leader  but the Germans surrendered unconditionally on May          ending the war in Europe  see V E Day      Rivalries that had begun during the war  combined with the sense of strength in the victorious powers  laid the foundations of the Iron Curtain and of the Cold War The war in the Pacific edit Main article  Asiatic Pacific TheaterBackground edit The first event that is usually linked to the later Pacific conflict was the Mukden Incident of    September       during which the Japanese military staged the bombing of the South Manchuria Railway and pinned the blame on Chinese dissidents      Japan then used this as pretext to invade northeastern China the next day and turn the region of Manchuria into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo      After the League of Nations commissioned the      Lytton Report  which exposed the Mukden Incident as a Japanese ruse  Japan was left internationally isolated  withdrawing from the League of Nations in March       In      Manchukuo became a constitutional monarchy and the former Chinese Emperor Pu Yi was placed on the throne  despite the real power being held by Japan     Despite relations between Japan and China suffering because the occupation of Manchuria  the situation did not turn into all out war until   July       when a dispute between Chinese and Japanese soldiers turned into a battle during the Marco Polo Bridge Incident      This  in turn  led to a further escalation of the hostilities  leading to the Second Sino Japanese War  one of the deadliest conflicts in human history      Japan enjoyed some early major victories  capturing both Shanghai and the Chinese capital of Nanjing in      and forcing the Chinese central government  s relocation to Chongqing  Following Chinese victories in Changsha and Guangxi in       the war reached somewhat of a stalemate  with Japan controlling the large cities  but being unable to rule the vast countryside      On    September       Japan became cosignatories of the Tripartite Pact  joining a military alliance with Germany and Italy     Japanese Expansion edit USS West Virginia during the attack on Pearl HarborOn December          Japan launched a surprise attack on the American base at Pearl Harbor as a mean of preventing the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned expansion in the area      The next day  following Roosevelt s Infamy Speech  the United States declared war on Japan  marking the official entry of both nations in World War             At the same time  Japan also launched attacks on Thailand  the British colonies of Malaya  Singapore  Hong Kong and American military bases in Guam  Wake Island and the Philippines      The next six months were dominated by Japanese victories against the Allied forces  already war weary and stretched thin after two years of war in Europe and North Africa  Japan managed to capture British Burma  New Guinea  the Dutch East Indies  the Solomon Islands  Bali and Timor       In March       days before the surrender of the Philippines  general Douglas MacArthur  who came out of retirement to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East at the onset of the war  was forced to flee and narrowly escape to Australia       On    February       Japan also launched a devastating aerial attack on the Australian city of Darwin  in what was the first attack by a foreign power on Australian soil      The turning of the tide came in early May  during the Battle of the Coral Sea  which proved the first strategic victory of the Allies against Japanese expansion       This was followed one month later by the Battle of Midway  in which the US Navy defeated an attacking Japanese fleet  inflicting devastating damage on the attacking force  The Battle of Midway is widely considered the most important naval battle of the Pacific Campaign and has even been described as  the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare       The reasons usually given for the resounding victory are Japanese overconfidence in their own forces  poor planning and the intercepting of Japanese battle plans by the United States       The losses suffered during this Battle of Midway  paired with the campaign of attrition that was taking place in Solomon Islands  left Japan unable to replenish its forces and turned the tides of war against it  By August       the Allied forces were on the offensive  earning victories in the New Guinea campaign at Guadalcanal  Milne Bay and Buna Gona      Allied offensive edit A map of the Japanese advance from      to     Over the next two years the Allies slowly captured one island base after another  trying to get closer to Japan itself  where it planned to launch massive strategic air attacks and  only if absolutely necessary  execute a ground invasion  By July       the US recaptured Guam and captured Tinian  which finally put them in attacking range of mainland Japan using the new Boeing B    bombers       Despite the advances of the Allies  massive fighting was still taking place  both in South East Asia with the Japanese offensive in India and in the Pacific  with the Battle of the Philippine Sea  where Japan suffered major losses and definitively lost the ability to rely on aircraft carriers       In later October  a combined attack of American and Australian forces took on the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in what was to be the largest naval battle of World War II and possibly the largest naval battle of all time       The Allied victory achieved its stated goal of further severing oil supplied to the Japanese army  which was already struggling to fuel the remainder of its naval power       The battle of Leyte Gulf is also notable as the first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized kamikaze attacks      By early       the Americans set their eyes on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima  which was of great strategic importance  being situated halfway between Tokyo and the Mariana Islands  Capturing the island meant not only a better launch station for aerial attacks against mainland Japan  but also the prevention of its use as an early warning station against air raids  The Japanese were expecting an attack and have been heavily fortifying the entire island for over a year       Despite the American troops outnumbering the Japanese to a rate of more than   to    the USA suffered heavy casualties in the    days of fighting  with over       Marines killed and another        wounded       leading some historians to question the strategic worth of the action       With Japan struggling to defend the homeland islands  counteroffensives in other parts of the Japanese Empire became more feasible  with important battles taking place in Burma  Borneo and China Continuing to come nearer the main Japanese islands  on   April      the US Marines mounted the largest amphibious assault of the Pacific Theater on the island of Okinawa       After a long campaign of island hopping  the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall  the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands which were only     miles away       The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific  with approximately         casualties on both sides  at least        Allied and                Japanese  Around half of the island s population of         were killed  committed suicide or went missing      Enola Gay s ground crew with mission commander Paul Tibbets in the center Final days edit The assaults on both Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved incredibly costly in terms of American lives and president Truman was horrified at the prospect of Operation Downfall  a planned boots on the ground invasion of mainland Japan that was estimated to lead to over a million casualties among American soldiers       Despite a devastating campaign of fire bombing in Tokyo and dozens of other cities  the Japanese showed no sign of planning to surrender  Following the Potsdam Declaration of July     where the Allies threatened  prompt and utter destruction  should Japan not surrender       the decision was made to resort to the first use of atomic bombs  On   August  the    d Bombardment Squadron B    Enola Gay  took off from Tinian and dropped the bomb on the city of Hiroshima  Three days later  a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki  The two bombings killed                 people  most of them civilians       On   August  the Soviet Union also invaded Manchukuo in what was to be the last campaign of the war      On    August the  sacred decision  was made by Japanese Cabinet to accept the Potsdam terms and on    August Emperor Hirohito broadcast to the nation and to the world at large the rescript of surrender  ending the Second World War       The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on   September       on the battleship USS Missouri  in Tokyo Bay  The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers      The Holocaust edit Main article  The HolocaustThe Holocaust  which roughly means  great fire   was the deliberate  systematic murder of millions of Jews and other minorities during World War II by Hitler s Nazi regime in Europe  Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war s beginning  or if the plans for it came about later            Regardless  persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started  such as in the Kristallnacht  literally  Crystal Night   Night of Broken Glass        The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up antisemitic feelings within ordinary Germans  Many people  including politicians and historians  consider the Holocaust to be the worst event in history  and have described Hitler  his followers  and his regime as evil Slave laborers at the Buchenwald concentration camp After the conquest of Poland  the Third Reich  which had previously deported Jews and other  undesirables   suddenly had within its borders the largest concentration of Jews in the world  The solution was to round up Jews and place them in Nazi concentration camps or in ghettos  cordoned off sections of cities where Jews were forced to live in deplorable conditions  often with tens of thousands starving to death  and the bodies decaying in the streets            As appalling as this sounds  they were the lucky ones  After the invasion of the Soviet Union  armed killing squads of SS men known as Einsatzgruppen systematically rounded up Jews and murdered an estimated one million Jews within the country       As barbaric and inhuman as this seems  it was too slow and inefficient by Nazi standards In       the top leadership met in Wannsee  a suburb of Berlin  and began to plan a more efficient way to slaughter the Jews       The Nazis created a system of extermination camps throughout Poland  and began rounding up Jews from the Soviet Union  and from the Ghettos            Not only were Jews shot or gassed to death en masse  but they were forced to provide slave labor and they were used in horrific medical experiments  see Human experimentation in Nazi Germany        Out of the widespread condemnation of the Nazis  medical experiments  the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics was devised      The Nazis took a sadistic pleasure in the death camps  the entrance to the most notorious camp  Auschwitz  stated  Arbeit Macht Frei   Work Sets You Free        In the end  six million Jews and up to   million homosexuals  Jehovah s Witnesses  Roma and political prisoners were killed by various means  mainly in the death camps                 An additional several million Soviet and other Allied prisoners of war died in camps and holding areas           There is some controversy over whether ordinary Germans knew about the Holocaust       It appears that many Germans knew about the concentration camps  such things were prominently displayed in magazines and newspapers       In many places  Jews had to walk past towns and villages on their way to work as slaves in German industry  In any case  Allied soldiers reported that the smell of the camps carried for miles       A very small number of people deny the Holocaust occurred entirely  though these claims have been routinely discredited by mainstream historians      The Nuclear Age begins edit Main article  History of nuclear weaponsDuring the     s  innovations in physics made it apparent that it could be possible to develop nuclear weapons of incredible power using nuclear reactions       When World War II broke out  scientists and advisors among the Allies feared that Nazi Germany may have been trying to develop its own atomic weapons  and the United States and the United Kingdom pooled their efforts in what became known as the Manhattan Project to beat them to it  At the secret Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico  scientist Robert Oppenheimer led a team of the world s top scientists to develop the first nuclear weapons  the first of which was tested at the Trinity site in July            However  Germany had surrendered in May       and it had been discovered that the German atomic bomb program had not been very close to success      The first nuclear explosion  named  Trinity   was detonated on July          The Allied team produced two nuclear weapons for use in the war  one powered by uranium     and the other by plutonium as fissionable material  named  Little Boy  and  Fat Man        These were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August   and         each  This  in combination with the Soviet invasion of Japanese controlled territory  convinced the Japanese government to surrender unconditionally  These two weapons remain the only two nuclear weapons ever used against other countries in war      Nuclear weapons brought an entirely new and terrifying possibility to warfare of nuclear annihilation  because it was feared that they would bring about the human extinction overnight  While at first the United States held a monopoly on the production of nuclear weapons  the Soviet Union  with some assistance from espionage  managed to detonate its first weapon  dubbed  Joe    by the West  in August                 The post war relations between the two  which had already been deteriorating  began to rapidly disintegrate  Soon the two were locked in a massive stockpiling of nuclear weapons  The United States began a crash program to develop the first hydrogen bomb in       and detonated its first thermonuclear weapon in       This new weapon was alone over     times as powerful as the weapons used against Japan  The Soviet Union detonated a primitive thermonuclear weapon in      and a full fledged one in           Nuclear missiles and computerized launch systems increased the range and scope of possible nuclear war The conflict continued to escalate  with the major superpowers developing long range missiles  such as the ICBM  and a nuclear strategy which guaranteed that any use of the nuclear weapons would be suicide for the attacking nation  Mutually Assured Destruction   The creation of early warning systems put the control of these weapons into the hands of newly created computers  and they served as a tense backdrop throughout the Cold War      Since the     s there were concerns about the rising proliferation of nuclear weapons to new countries  which was seen as being destabilizing to international relations  spurring regional arms races  and generally increasing the likelihood of some form of nuclear war  Eventually  nine nations would overtly develop nuclear weapons  and still maintain stockpiles today  the United States  the Soviet Union  and later Russia would inherit these   the United Kingdom  France  China  India  Pakistan  Israel and North Korea       South Africa developed six crude weapons in the     s  which it later dismantled        and Israel almost certainly developed nuclear weapons though it never confirmed nor denied it       The creation of the Nuclear Non proliferation Treaty in      was an attempt to curtail such proliferation       but a number of countries developed nuclear weapons since it was signed  and many did not sign it   and several other countries  including Libya and Iran were suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs           The post war world edit Main article  Post World War II economic expansionFollowing World War II  the majority of the industrialized world lay in ruins as a result of aerial bombings  naval bombardment  and protracted land campaigns  The United States was a notable exception to this  barring Pearl Harbor and some minor incidents  the United States had suffered no attacks upon its territory       The United States and the Soviet Union  which  despite the devastation of its most populated areas  rebuilt quickly  found themselves the world s two dominant superpowers      Much of Western Europe was rebuilt after the war with assistance from the Marshall Plan  Germany  chief instigator of the war  was placed under joint military occupation by the United States  Great Britain  France  and the Soviet Union  Berlin  although in Soviet controlled territory  was also divided among the four powers       Occupation of Berlin would continue until       Japan was also placed under United States occupation  that would last seven years  until            Oddly  these two Axis powers  despite military occupation  soon rose to become the second  Japan  and third  West Germany  most powerful economies in the world      Following the end of the war  the Allies famously prosecuted numerous German officials for war crimes and other offenses in the Nuremberg Trials  Although Adolf Hitler had committed suicide  many of his cronies  including Hermann G ring  were convicted  Less well known trials of other Axis officials also occurred  including the Tokyo War Crime Trial      The failure of the League of Nations to prevent World War II essentially discredited the organization  and it was dissolved       A new attempt at world peace was begun with the founding of the United Nations on October           in San Francisco       Today  nearly all countries are members  but despite its many successes  the organization s success at achieving its goal of world peace is disputed  The organization was never given enough power to overcome the conflicting interests and priorities of its member nations The end of empires  decolonization edit Michael Somare  the first leader of an independent Papua New Guinea Main articles  Decolonization and New ImperialismAlmost all of the major nations that were involved in World War II began shedding their overseas colonies soon after the conflict  The tactics employed by the revolutionaries ranged from non violent forms of protest to armed rebellions  depending on the nation involved            Immediately after the war  European powers began a decades long process of withdrawing from their possessions in Africa and Asia In India  Mahatma Gandhi became a global icon for his non violent struggle to achieve Indian independence whereas Mohamed Ali Jinnah advocated for the independence of a separate state for Muslims  This was achieved in      with the end of British rule in India and the Partition of the territory into modern day India and Pakistan  which would later also further divide  leading to the creation of the People s Republic of Bangladesh in                 Elsewhere in Asia  The United States granted independence to the Philippines  its major Pacific possession in            In French Indochina  armed insurrections forced the French out in the early     s  leading to the formation of Laos  Cambodia and Vietnam      In Africa  nationalists such as Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana led their respective nations to independence from foreign rule       Mere decades before  the British Empire controlled almost half of the continent  but by       the only British possession in Africa was Seychelles  which would also become independent in        Between      and       almost    African countries achieved their independence from France       Through the efforts of Am lcar Cabral and others  the Portuguese colonies of Guinea Bissau  Cape Verde  Angola  Mozambique and S o Tom  and Pr ncipe followed suit and achieved independence during the mid     s  in what was to be the last important wave of African decolonization      In       there were    member states in the United Nations  but as the newly independent nations joined the organization  by      membership increased to          The emergence of newly independent countries in Africa and Asia that used the borders of the imperial partitions later led to further conflict       In many cases this meant that historically antagonistic ethnic or religious groups now needed to share the same country or that several nations held territorial claims over regions which were more or less arbitrarily divided by European powers            Some conflicts which aroused from these tensions  especially the Nigerian Civil War  the Second Congo War  the Second Sudanese Civil War and the Bangladesh Liberation War have been among the bloodiest wars of the   th century      The Cold War             edit Post war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern BlocMain articles  Cold War and Mutual assured destructionDuring the Yalta Conference  where the Western  capitalist powers  and the communist Soviet Union agreed on separate spheres of influence in Europe  they set up the stage for a geopolitical rivalry that would dominate international relations for the next five decades       In March       Winston Churchill gave a now famous speech while visiting Westminster College in the US which is usually credited as the first use of the term iron curtain to refer to the separation of Soviet and Western areas of influence in Europe      From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent  Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe  Warsaw  Berlin  Prague  Vienna  Budapest  Belgrade  Bucharest and Sofia  all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere  and all are subject  in one form or another  not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow Indeed  the Soviet Union had already annexed several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics during the war  Eastern Poland  incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR        Latvia  which became the Latvian SSR   Estonia  which became the Estonian SSR   Lithuania   which became the Lithuanian SSR        part of eastern Finland  which became the Karelo Finnish SSR       and eastern Romania  part of which became the Moldavian SSR       were now wholly part of Soviet Union  Furthermore  between      and       Yugoslavia  Albania  Bulgaria  Poland  Romania  Czechoslovakia  Hungary and East Germany saw communist regimes coming to power and their transformation into People s Republics       While they remained independent countries and their relation with the Soviet authorities would fluctuate over the next half century  they were widely seen as Soviet satellite states  Outside of Europe  countries that would see the rise of communism and would ally themselves to the communist bloc include Mongolia  China  North Korea  Cuba and Vietnam      The spread of the communist ideology in general and the Soviet influence in particular made Western leaders nervous and it even lead to Churchill considering a preemptive attack on the USSR even before World War II was formally ended      The two rival blocks also coalesced into formal mutual defense organizations  with the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  in           and the Warsaw Pact in            each determine to expand its own influence among unaligned countries and limit the influence of their rivals War by proxy edit Main articles  Korean War  Vietnam War  and Cuban Missile CrisisTwo wars and a near war in the     s became the focus for capitalist versus communist struggle  The first war was the Korean War  fought between People s Republic of China backed North Korea and mainly United States backed South Korea  The Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony between      and       when Soviet and American troops invaded and divided it along the   th parallel       A communist government controlled the territory north of the border and a capitalist one controlled the South  with both authorities considering the other one illegitimate and claiming sovereignty over the entire peninsula       North Korea s invasion of South Korea on June          led to United Nations intervention       General Douglas MacArthur led troops from the United States  Canada  Australia  Great Britain  and other countries in repulsing the Northern invasion  However  the war reached a stalemate after Chinese intervention pushed U N  forces back  and an Armistice ended hostilities in July       leaving the two Koreas divided and tense for the rest of the century      The second war  the Vietnam War  was perhaps the third most visible war of the   th century  after World War I and World War II  After the French withdrawal from its former colony  on    July       Vietnam became partitioned into two halves  much like Korea  along the   th parallel  Fighting between North and South eventually escalated into a regional war  The United States provided aid to South Vietnam      and contributed to propaganda efforts against the North       but was not directly involved until the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution  passed in reaction to a supposed North Vietnamese attack upon American destroyers  brought the United States into the war as a belligerent       The war was initially viewed as a fight to contain communism  see containment  Truman Doctrine  and Domino Theory   but  as more Americans were drafted and news of events such as the Tet Offensive and My Lai massacre leaked out  American sentiment turned against the war            United States President Richard Nixon was elected partially on a promise to end the war  This Nixon Doctrine involved a gradual pullout of American forces  South Vietnamese units were supposed to replace them  backed up by American air power  The plan went awry  with Nixon  deliberately sabotaging peace talks for political gain       and the war spilled into neighboring Cambodia while South Vietnamese forces were pushed further back       Eventually  the United States and North Vietnam signed the Paris Peace Accords  ending United States involvement in the war       With the threat of United States retaliation gone  the North proceeded to violate the ceasefire and invaded the South with full military force  Saigon was captured on April           and Vietnam was unified under Communist rule a year later  effectively bringing an end to one of the most unpopular wars of all time           The Cuban Missile Crisis illustrates just how close to the brink of nuclear war the world came during the Cold War  Cuba  under Fidel Castro s socialist government  had formed close ties with the Soviet Union       This was obviously disquieting to the United States  given Cuba s proximity  When Lockheed U   spy plane flights over the island revealed that Soviet missile launchers were being installed  United States President John F  Kennedy instituted a naval blockade and publicly confronted the Soviet Union  After a tense week  the Soviet Union backed down and ordered the launchers removed  not wanting to risk igniting a new world war           The space race edit In       humans first set foot on the Moon Main article  Space RaceWith Cold War tensions running high  the Soviet Union and United States took their rivalry to the stars in      with the Soviet launch of Sputnik       A  space race  between the two powers followed       The USSR reached several important milestones  such as the first craft on the Moon  Luna         and the first human in space  Yuri Gagarin        The United States pulled ahead eventually with its Mercury  Gemini  and Apollo programs  which culminated in Apollo    astronauts landing on the Moon on    July            Five more landings with astronauts followed  Apollo    was forced to abort its mission        Nevertheless  despite its successes  the United States space program could not match many major achievements of the Soviet space program  such as rover based space exploration and image and video transfer from the surface of another planet  until the early   st century           In addition  both countries launched numerous probes into space  such as the Venera   and Voyager        In later decades  space became a somewhat friendlier place  Regular space flights with astronauts were made possible with the American Space Shuttle  which was the first reusable spacecraft to be successfully used       Mir and Skylab enabled prolonged human habitation in space            In the     s  work on the International Space Station began  and by the end of the century  while still incomplete  it was in continual use by astronauts from the United States  Europe  Russia  Japan  and Canada      The end of the Cold War edit In       the Berlin Wall separating West and East Berlin fell Main article  Cold War            By the     s  the Soviet Union was weakening  The Sino Soviet split had removed the USSR s most powerful ally  the People s Republic of China       Its arms race with the United States was draining the country of funds  and further weakened by internal pressures  ethnic and political  Mikhail Gorbachev  its last leader  attempted to reform the country with glasnost and perestroika       but the formation of Solidarity       the fall of the Berlin Wall       and the breaking off of several Soviet republics  such as Lithuania       started a slippery slope of events that culminated in a coup to overthrow Gorbachev  organized by Communist Party hard liners  Boris Yeltsin  president of Russia  organized mass opposition  and the coup failed       On December           the Soviet Union was officially disbanded into its constituent republics  thus putting a final line under the already exhausted Cold War      Information and communications technology edit Main articles  Computer  History of computing hardware  and InternetThe creation of the transistor revolutionized the development of the computer  The first computers  room sized electro mechanical devices built to break cryptographical codes during World War II       quickly became at least    times smaller using transistors       Computers became reprogrammable rather than fixed purpose devices  The invention of programming languages meant computer operators could concentrate on problem solving at a high level  without having to think in terms of the individual instructions to the computer itself       The creation of operating systems also vastly improved programming productivity  Building on this  computer pioneers could now realize what they had envisioned  The graphical user interface  piloted by a computer mouse made it simple to harness the power of the computer and made it more accessible to new users       Storage for computer programs progressed from punched cards and paper tape to magnetic tape  floppy disks and hard disks  Core memory and bubble memory fell to random access memory      Colossus Mark   computer operated by WrensThe invention of the word processor  spreadsheet and database greatly improved office productivity over the old paper  typewriter and filing cabinet methods            The economic advantage given to businesses led to economic efficiencies in computers themselves  Cost effective CPUs led to thousands of industrial and home brew computer designs  many of which became successful  a home computer boom was led by the Apple II  the ZX   and the Commodore PET           IBM  seeking to embrace the microcomputer revolution  devised its IBM Personal Computer  PC   Crucially  IBM developed the PC from third party components that were available on the open market       The only impediment to another company duplicating the system s architecture was the proprietary BIOS software  Other companies  starting with Compaq  reverse engineered the BIOS and released PC compatible computers that soon became the dominant architecture            Microsoft  which produced an operating system for the PC  rode this wave of popularity to become the world s leading software company      The     s heralded the Information Age  The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal  information  as valuable as physical commodities  This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues  The United States Government made algorithms patentable  forming the basis of software patents       The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project  paving the way for a free software movement      Computers also became a usable platform for entertainment  Computer games were first developed by software programmers exercising their creativity on large systems at universities  but these efforts became commercially successful in arcade games such as Pong and Space Invaders       Once the home computer market was established  young programmers in their bedrooms became the core of a youthful video game industry       In order to take advantage of advancing technology  games consoles were created  Like arcade systems  these machines had custom hardware designed to do game oriented operations  such as sprites and parallax scrolling  in preference to general purpose computing tasks      The first model of the IBM PC  the personal computer whose successors would fill the world Computer networks appeared in two main styles  the local area network  linking computers in an office or school to each other  and the wide area network  linking the local area networks together  Initially  computers depended on the telephone networks to link to each other  spawning the Bulletin Board sub culture       However  a DARPA project to create bomb proof computer networks led to the creation of the Internet  a network of networks  The core of this network was the robust TCP IP network protocol       Thanks to efforts from Al Gore  the Internet grew beyond its military role when universities and commercial businesses were permitted to connect their networks to it            The main impetus for this was electronic mail  a far faster and convenient form of communication than a conventional letter and memo distribution  and the File Transfer Protocol  FTP   However  the Internet remained largely unknown to the general public  who were used to Bulletin Boards and services like Compuserve and America Online  This changed when Tim Berners Lee devised a simpler form of Vannevar Bush s hypertext  which he dubbed the World Wide Web        The Web  suddenly changed the Internet into a printing press beyond the geographic boundaries of physical countries  it was termed  cyberspace   Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could write pages in the simple HTML format and publish their thoughts to the world      The Web s immense success also fueled the commercial use of the Internet  Convenient home shopping had been an element of  visions of the future  since the development of the telephone  but now the race was on to provide convenient  interactive consumerism       Companies trading through websites became known as  dot coms   due to the   com  suffix of commercial Internet addresses       The change of the century also lead to the fear and paranoia of Y K  where it was hypothesized that the World s computers would glitch and cause havoc on banks  prisons  transit systems and more The world at the end of the century edit Main article      sBy the end of the century  more technological advances and scientific discoveries had been made than in all of preceding history  Communications and information technology  transportation technology  and medical advances have radically altered daily lives  Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history  The people of the Indian subcontinent  a sixth of the world population at the end of the century  had attained indigenous independence for the first time in centuries  China  an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world s population  was finally open to the world in a new and powerful synthesis of West and East  creating a new state after the near complete destruction of the old cultural order   With the end of colonialism and the Cold War  nearly a billion people in Africa were left with truly independent new nation states  some cut from whole cloth  standing up after centuries of foreign domination      The geographic distribution of surface warming during the   st century calculated by the HadCM  climate model if a business as usual scenario is assumed for economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions  In this figure  the globally averaged warming corresponds to      C       F  The world was undergoing its second major period of globalization  the first  which started in the   th century  having been terminated by World War I       Since the US was in a position of almost unchallenged domination  a major part of the process was Americanization       This led to anti Western and anti American feelings in parts of the world  especially the Middle East       The influence of China and India was also rising  as the world s largest populations  long marginalized by the West and by their rulers  were rapidly integrating with the world economy      However  several problems face the world  The gap between rich and poor nations continued to widen  Some said that this problem could not be fixed  that there was a set amount of wealth and it could only be shared by so many  Others said that the powerful nations with large economies were not doing enough to help improve the rapidly evolving economies of the Third World  However  developing countries faced many challenges  including the scale of the task to be surmounted  rapidly growing populations  and the need to protect the environment and the cost that goes along with it Terrorism  dictatorship  and the spread of nuclear weapons were other issues requiring attention  The world was still blighted by small scale wars and other violent conflicts  fueled by competition over resources and ethnic conflicts  Despots such as Kim Jong il of North Korea continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons      Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world  New viruses such as SARS and West Nile continued to spread            In poor nations  malaria and other diseases affected the majority of the population  Millions were infected with HIV  the virus which causes AIDS  The virus was becoming an epidemic in southern Africa      Perhaps most importantly  it was speculated that in the long term  environmental problems threatened the planet s livability  The most serious problem was global warming  which was predicted to frequently flood coastal areas  due to human caused emission of greenhouse gases  particularly carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels  Like the threat of a nuclear world war  the shift of climate change has since added to the fear of the possibility of human extinction  although not overnight but over several decades       This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign the Kyoto treaty  which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions      The celebration of the   th century s ending expressed the popular opinion that New Year s Eve      and New Year s Day      marked the turn of the millennium  while strictly speaking the   th century ended on New Year s Eve      and the   st century began on New Year s Day      See also edit Timeline of the   th centuryInfectious disease in the   th centuryDeath rates in the   th centuryList of battles            th century inventions  th
