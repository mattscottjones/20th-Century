11,It was widely believed that the war would be short  Unfortunately  since trench warfare was the best form of defense  advances on both sides were very slow and came at a terrible cost to lives     Division of Austria Hungary after World War IWhen the war was finally over in       the results would set the stage for the next twenty years  First and foremost  the Germans were forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles  forcing them to make exorbitant payments to repair damages caused during the War  Many Germans felt these reparations were unfair because they did not actually  lose  the war nor did they feel they caused the war  see Stab in the back legend       Germany was never occupied by Allied troops  ,"['Austria Hungary', 'World War IWhen', 'the next twenty years  First', 'Germans', 'the Treaty of Versailles', 'the War  Many Germans', 'Stab', 'Germany', 'Allied']",['Germany']
12,yet it had to accept a liberal democratic government imposed on it by the victors after the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm     Much of the map of Europe was redrawn by the victors based upon the theory that future wars could be prevented if all ethnic groups had their own  homeland    New states like Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were created out of the former Austro Hungarian Empire to accommodate the nationalist aspirations of these groups       An international body called the League of Nations was formed to mediate disputes and prevent future wars  although its effectiveness was severely limited by  among other things  its reluctance and inability to act     The Russian Revolution and Communism edit Main article  Russian RevolutionThe Russian Revolution of       ending in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the execution of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II and his family  sparked a wave of communist revolutions across Europe  prompting many to believe that a socialist world revolution could be realized in the near future      However  the European revolutions were defeated  Vladimir Lenin died in       and within a few years  Joseph Stalin displaced Leon Trotsky as the de facto leader of the Soviet Union  ,"['Kaiser Wilhelm     Much', 'Europe', 'Yugoslavia', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Austro Hungarian Empire', 'the League of Nations', 'The Russian Revolution and Communism', 'Russian', 'Tsarist', 'communist', 'Europe', 'European', 'Vladimir Lenin', 'a few years', 'Joseph Stalin', 'Leon Trotsky', 'the Soviet Union']","['Yugoslavia', 'Czechoslovakia']"
13,The idea of worldwide revolution was no longer in the forefront  as Stalin concentrated on  socialism in one country      and embarked on a bold plan of collectivization and industrialization      ,"['Stalin', 'one']",[]
14,The majority of socialists and even many communists became disillusioned with Stalin s autocratic rule  his purges and the assassination of his  enemies   as well as the news of famines he imposed on his own people     Communism was strengthened as a force in Western democracies when the global economy crashed in      in what became known as the Great Depression  Many people saw this as the first stage of the end of the capitalist system and were attracted to Communism as a solution to the economic crisis  especially as the Soviet Union s economic development in the     s was strong  unaffected by the capitalist world s crisis     Between the wars edit Dorothea Lange s      photo Migrant Mother is one of the most iconic photos associated with the Great DepressionMain article  Interwar periodEconomic depression edit Main articles  Roaring Twenties and Great DepressionAfter World War I  the global economy remained strong through most of the     s  The war had provided a stimulus for industry and economic activity in general  There were many warning signs foretelling the Crash of    of the global economic system at the end of the decade  that were generally not understood by the political leadership of the time      ,"['socialists', 'Stalin', 'the Great Depression', 'first', 'the Soviet Union', 'Dorothea Lange', 'Migrant Mother', 'Roaring Twenties', 'the end of the decade']",[]
15,The responses to the crisis often made the situation worse  as millions of people watched their savings become next to worthless  and the idea of a steady job with a reasonable income fading away     Many sought answers from alternative ideologies such as communism and fascism      They believed that the capitalist economic system was collapsing and that new ideas were required to meet the crisis  ,['as millions'],[]
16,The early responses to the crisis were based on the assumption that the free market would correct itself  This  however  did very little to correct the crisis or to alleviate the suffering of many ordinary people  ,[],[]
17,Thus  the idea that the existing system could be reformed by government intervention in the economy  rather than by continuing the laissez faire approach  became prominent as a solution to the crisis  Democratic governments assumed the responsibility to provide needed services in society  and to alleviate poverty  ,['Democratic'],[]
18,Thus was born the welfare state      These two politico economic principles  the belief in government intervention and the welfare state  as opposed to the belief in the free market and private institutions  would define many political battles for the rest of the century The rise of dictatorship edit Main articles  Fascism  Totalitarianism  and DictatorshipNazi soldiers hang a poster on the window of Jewish owned business  that says   Germans  defend yourselves  Do not buy from Jews   Germany      Fascism first appeared in Italy with the rise to power of Benito Mussolini in           The ideology was supported by a large proportion of the upper classes as a strong challenge to the threat of communism     When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in       a new variant of fascism called Nazism took over Germany and ended the German experiment with democracy  The Nazi Party in Germany was dedicated to the restoration of German honor and prestige  the unification of German speaking peoples  and the annexation of Central and Eastern Europe as vassal states  with the Slavic population to act as slave labor to serve German economic interests       There was also a strong appeal to a mythical racial purity  the idea that Germans were the Herrenvolk or the  master race    and a vicious antisemitism which promoted the idea of Jews as subhuman  Untermensch  and worthy only of extermination     Many people in Western Europe and the United States greeted the rise of Hitler with relief or indifference      They could see nothing wrong with a strong Germany ready to take on the communist menace to the east  Antisemitism during the Great Depression was widespread as many were content to blame the Jews for causing the economic downturn     Hitler began to put his plan in motion  annexing Austria in the Anschluss  or reunification of Austria to Germany  in           He then negotiated the annexation of the Sudetenland  a German speaking mountainous area of Czechoslovakia  in the Munich Conference      The British were eager to avoid war and believed Hitler s assurance to protect the security of the Czech state   Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech state shortly afterwards  indicating that he had ulterior motives     Fascism was not the only form of dictatorship to rise in the post war period   Almost all of the new democracies in the nations of Eastern Europe collapsed and were replaced by authoritarian regimes      Spain also became a dictatorship under the leadership of General Francisco Franco after the Spanish Civil War      Totalitarian states attempted to achieve total control over their subjects as well as their total loyalty  They held the state above the individual  and were often responsible for some of the worst acts in history  such as the Holocaust Adolf Hitler perpetrated on European Jews  or the Great Purge Stalin perpetrated in the Soviet Union in the     s Global war  World War II             edit Main article  World War IIThe war in Europe edit Main article  European Theater of,"['two', 'the century', 'Jewish', 'Germans', 'Jews', 'Germany', 'first', 'Italy', 'Benito Mussolini', 'Adolf Hitler', 'Germany', 'Nazism', 'Germany', 'German', 'The Nazi Party', 'Germany', 'German', 'German', 'Central and Eastern Europe', 'Slavic', 'German', 'Germans', 'Herrenvolk', 'Jews', 'Untermensch', 'Western Europe', 'the United States', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'the Great Depression', 'Jews', 'Hitler', 'Austria', 'Anschluss', 'Austria', 'Germany', 'Sudetenland', 'German', 'Czechoslovakia', 'the Munich Conference      ', 'British', 'Hitler', 'Czech', 'Hitler', 'Czech', 'Eastern Europe', 'Spain', 'Francisco Franco', 'the Spanish Civil War      Totalitarian', 'Hitler', 'European', 'Jews', 'the Great Purge Stalin', 'the Soviet Union', 'World War II             ', 'World War IIThe war', 'Europe', 'European Theater of']","['Germany', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'Austria', 'Germany', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Spain']"
19,World War IIThis section provides a conversational overview of World War II in Europe  See main article for a fuller discussion The signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact in Moscow  August         Soon after the events in Czechoslovakia  Britain and France issued assurances of protection to Poland  which seemed to be next on Hitler s list  World War II officially began on September          when Hitler unleashed his Blitzkrieg  or lightning war  against Poland  Britain and France  much to Hitler s surprise  immediately declared war upon Germany  but the help they delivered to Poland was negligible      Sixteen days later  Poland was attacked from the East by Soviet Union  acting in a secret alliance with Nazi Germany      After only a few weeks  the Polish forces were overwhelmed  and its government fled to exile in London  see Polish government in Exile  In starting World War II  the Germans had unleashed a new type of warfare  characterized by highly mobile forces and the use of massed aircraft  The German strategy concentrated upon the devotion of the Wehrmacht  or German army  to the use of tank groups  called panzer divisions  and groups of mobile infantry  in concert with relentless attacks from the air  Encirclement was also a major part of the strategy  ,"['World War IIThis', 'World War II', 'Europe', 'the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact', 'Moscow', 'August         Soon', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Britain', 'France', 'Poland', 'Hitler', 'World War II', 'September', 'Hitler', 'Blitzkrieg', 'Poland', 'Britain', 'France', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'Sixteen days later', 'Poland', 'East', 'Soviet Union', 'Nazi', 'only a few weeks', 'Polish', 'London', 'Polish', 'Exile', 'World War II', 'Germans', 'German', 'Wehrmacht', 'German']","['Czechoslovakia', 'France', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'France', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'Poland']"
20,This change smashed any expectations that the Second World War would be fought in the trenches like the first     As Hitler s forces conquered Poland  the Soviet Union  under General Secretary Joseph Stalin  was acting out guarantees of territory under a secret part of a nonaggression pact between the United StatesSR and Germany known as the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  ,"['the Second World War', 'first', 'Hitler', 'Poland', 'the Soviet Union', 'General', 'Joseph Stalin', 'United', 'Germany', 'the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact']","['Poland', 'Germany']"
21,This treaty gave Stalin free rein to take the Baltic republics of Estonia  Latvia  and Lithuania  as well as Eastern Poland  all of which would remain in Soviet possession after the war      Stalin also launched an attack on Finland  which he hoped to reduce to little more than a Soviet puppet state  but the Red Army met staunch Finnish resistance in what became known as the Winter War and succeeded in gaining only limited territory from the Finns      This action would later cause the Finns to ally with Germany when its attack on the Soviet Union came in          Blitzkrieg edit After the defeat of Poland  a period known as the Phony War ensued during the winter of            which saw only limited military land operation on the Western Front      All of this changed on May           when the Germans launched a massive attack on the Low Countries  Belgium  the Netherlands  and Luxembourg   most probably to surmount the Maginot Line of defenses on the Franco German border      This witnessed the incredible fall of Eben Emael  a Belgian fort considered impregnable and guarded by     Belgians  to a force of only    German paratroopers  ,"['Stalin', 'Baltic', 'Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania', 'Eastern Poland', 'Soviet', 'Stalin', 'Finland', 'Soviet', 'the Red Army', 'Finnish', 'the Winter War', 'Finns', 'Finns', 'Germany', 'the Soviet Union', 'Poland', 'the Phony War', 'the winter', 'May           ', 'Germans', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'Luxembourg', 'the Maginot Line', 'German', 'Eben Emael', 'Belgian', 'German']","['Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania', 'Finland', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'Luxembourg']"
22,The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May    without warning his allies  exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups      Following the conquest of the Low Countries  Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway  beginning on April          Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine  Norway held on for a few crucial weeks  but Denmark surrendered after only six hours          Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war  with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies     With the disaster in the Low Countries  France  considered at the time to have had the finest army in the world  lasted only four weeks  with Paris being occupied on June     Three days later  Marshal Philippe P tain surrendered to the Germans      The debacle in France also led to one of the war s greatest mysteries  and Hitler s first great blunder  Dunkirk  where a third of a million trapped British and French soldiers were evacuated by not only British war boats  but every craft the army could find  including fishing boats  Hitler refused to  risk  his panzers on an action at Dunkirk  listening to the advice of Air Minister Hermann G ring and allowing the Luftwaffe  or German Air Force  to handle the job      The irony of this was that the escaped men would form the core of the army that was to invade the beaches of Normandy in       Hitler did not occupy all of France  but about three quarters  including all of the Atlantic coast  allowing Marshal P tain to remain as dictator of an area known as Vichy France      However  members of the escaped French Army formed around General Charles de Gaulle to create the Free French forces  which would continue to battle Hitler in the stead of an independent France      ,"['Belgium', 'Germans', 'May', 'Allied', 'German', 'Hitler', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'April', 'Norway', 'Swedish', 'Nazi', 'Norway', 'a few crucial weeks', 'Denmark', 'only six hours', 'Sweden', 'Scandinavian', 'Germany', 'the Western Allies     With', 'France', 'only four weeks', 'Paris', 'June     ', 'Three days later', 'Germans', 'France', 'Hitler', 'first', 'Dunkirk', 'a third', 'British', 'French', 'British', 'Hitler', 'Dunkirk', 'Hermann G', 'Luftwaffe', 'German Air Force', 'Hitler', 'France', 'about three quarters', 'Atlantic', 'Marshal P', 'Vichy France      ', 'French Army', 'Charles de Gaulle', 'French', 'Hitler', 'France      ']","['Belgium', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Norway', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Sweden', 'Germany', 'France', 'France', 'France']"
23,At this moment  Italy  under Benito Mussolini  declared war on the Allies on June     thinking that the war was almost over  but he managed only to occupy a few hundred yards of French territory      Throughout the war  the Italians would be more of a burden to the Nazis than a boon  and would later cost them precious time in Greece         German Heinkel He     bombers during the Battle of BritainHitler now turned his eyes on Great Britain  which stood alone against him  ,"['Italy', 'Benito Mussolini', 'June', 'a few hundred yards', 'French', 'Italians', 'Nazis', 'Greece', 'the Battle of BritainHitler', 'Great Britain']","['Italy', 'Greece']"
24,He ordered his generals to draw up plans for an invasion  code named Operation Sea Lion  and ordered the Luftwaffe to launch a massive air war against the British isles  which would come to be known as the Battle of Britain  The British at first suffered steady losses  but eventually managed to turn the air war against Germany  taking down       German planes throughout the summer of      to only     Royal Air Force  RAF  losses      The key turning point came when the Germans discontinued successful attacks against British airplane factories and radar command and coordination stations and turned to civilian bombing known as terror bombing using the distinctive  bomb  sound created by the German dive bomber  the Stuka      The switch came after a small British bombing force had attacked Berlin      Hitler was infuriated  However  his decision to switch the attacks  focus allowed the British to rebuild the RAF and eventually force the Germans to indefinitely postpone Sea Lion     The importance of the Battle of Britain is that it marked the first of Hitler s defeats  however its overall impact was overshadowed by his later blunders in the east  Secondly  it marked the advent of radar as a major weapon in modern air war   With radar  squadrons of fighters could be quickly assembled to respond to incoming bombers attempting to bomb civilian targets  It also allowed the identification of the type and a guess at the number of incoming enemy aircraft  as well as tracking of friendly airplanes     Operation Barbarossa edit Hitler  taken aback by his defeat over the skies of Britain  now turned his gaze eastward to the Soviet Union  Despite having signed the non aggression pact with Stalin  Hitler despised communism and wished to destroy it in the land of its birth  He originally planned to launch the attack in early spring of      to avoid the disastrous Russian winter  ,"['Operation Sea Lion', 'Luftwaffe', 'British', 'Britain', 'British', 'first', 'Germany', 'German', 'the summer', 'Royal Air Force', 'RAF', 'Germans', 'British', 'German', 'the Stuka      The', 'British', 'Berlin      Hitler', 'British', 'RAF', 'Germans', 'the Battle of Britain', 'first', 'Hitler', 'Secondly', 'Hitler', 'Britain', 'the Soviet Union', 'Stalin  Hitler', 'early spring', 'Russian']",['Germany']
25,However  a pro allied coup in Yugoslavia and Mussolini s almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupied Albania prompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time      ,"['Yugoslavia', 'Mussolini', 'Greece', 'Albania', 'Hitler', 'Yugoslavia', 'Greece']","['Yugoslavia', 'Greece', 'Albania', 'Yugoslavia', 'Greece']"
26,The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts  the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the United StatesSR  potentially hampering it     Europe at the height of German control in     On June           Hitler attacked Stalin with the largest army the world had ever seen  Over three million men and their weapons were put into service against the Soviet Union      Stalin had been warned about the attack  both by other countries and by his own intelligence network  but he had refused to believe it  Therefore  the Soviet army was largely unprepared and suffered massive setbacks in the early part of the war  despite Stalin s orders to counterattack the Germans      Throughout       German forces  divided into   army groups  Army Group A  Army Group B  and Army Group C   occupied the territories of the present day Ukraine and Belarus  laid siege to Leningrad  present day Saint Petersburg   and advanced to within    miles of Moscow  ,"['several crucial weeks', 'United', 'Europe', 'German', 'June           Hitler', 'Stalin', 'the Soviet Union', 'Stalin', 'Soviet', 'Stalin', 'the Germans', 'German', 'Army Group A  Army Group', 'Army Group C', 'Ukraine', 'Belarus', 'Leningrad', 'Saint Petersburg', 'Moscow']","['Ukraine', 'Belarus']"
27,At this critical moment  the Soviet people stalled the German Wehrmacht to a halt at the gates of Moscow  Stalin had planned to evacuate the city  and had already moved important government functions  but decided to stay and rally the city  Recently arrived troops from the east under the command of Marshal Georgy Zhukov counterattacked the Germans and drove them from Moscow     Mussolini had launched an offensive in North Africa from Italian controlled Libya into British controlled Egypt  However  the British smashed the Italians and were on the verge of taking Libya  Hitler decided to help by sending in a few thousand troops  a Luftwaffe division  and the first rate general Erwin Rommel      Rommel managed to use his small force to repeatedly smash massively superior British forces and to recapture the port city of Tobruk and advance into Egypt  However  Hitler  embroiled in his invasion of the Soviet Union  refused to send Rommel any more troops  causing Rommel to retreat and preventing him from seizing the Middle East  where Axis friendly regimes had taken root in Iraq and Persia  present day Iran          After the winter  Hitler launched a fresh offensive in the spring of       with the aim of capturing the oil rich Caucacus and the city of Stalingrad  However  he repeatedly switched his troops to where they were not needed  The offensive bogged down  and the entire  th Army  considered the best of German troops  was trapped in Stalingrad  Hitler now refused to let  th Army break out  ,"['Soviet', 'German', 'Moscow', 'Stalin', 'Georgy Zhukov', 'Germans', 'Moscow', 'Mussolini', 'North Africa', 'Italian', 'Libya', 'British', 'Egypt', 'British', 'Italians', 'Libya', 'Hitler', 'a few thousand', 'Luftwaffe', 'first', 'Erwin Rommel', 'British', 'Tobruk', 'Egypt', 'Hitler', 'the Soviet Union', 'Rommel', 'Rommel', 'the Middle East', 'Iraq', 'Persia', 'Iran          After', 'winter', 'Hitler', 'the spring', 'Caucacus', 'Stalingrad', 'Army', 'German', 'Stalingrad  Hitler', 'Army']","['Libya', 'Egypt', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Iraq']"
28,He insisted that the German army would force its way in  Hermann G ring also assured Hitler that the Luftwaffe could supply the  th Army adequately  when it could in reality only supply a minute fraction of the needed ammunition and rations  Eventually  the starved  th Army surrendered  dealing a severe blow to the Germans  In the end  the defeat at Stalingrad was the turning point for the war in the east     Meanwhile  the Japanese had attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December          ,"['German', 'Hermann G', 'Hitler', 'Luftwaffe', 'Army', 'Army', 'Germans', 'Stalingrad', 'Japanese', 'the United States', 'Pearl Harbor', 'Hawaii', 'December']",[]
29,This disastrous attack forced the Americans into the war  Parts of the German brass advised against declaring war on the United States  arguing that since Japan was the aggressor  the Tripartite Pact didn t bind Germany to do so  However  Hitler hoped that Japan would be able to quickly defeat the United States and then turn its attention on helping the effort against Russia  Both Germany and Italy declared war on the United States a few days after the attack     Turning tides edit A British soldier gives a V gesture to German prisoners captured at El Alamein     October     Throughout the rest of      and       the Soviets began to gain ground against the Germans after some victories like the tank battle of Kursk      ,"['Americans', 'German', 'the United States', 'Japan', 'Tripartite Pact', 'Germany', 'Hitler', 'Japan', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'the United States', 'a few days', 'British', 'German', 'El Alamein', 'October', 'Soviets', 'Germans', 'Kursk      ']","['Japan', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Italy']"

31,On several fronts  the Wehrmacht had encountered serious casualties that it could not replace  Hitler also insisted on a  hold at all costs  policy which forbade relinquishing any ground  ,"['Wehrmacht', 'Hitler']",[]
32,He followed a  fight to the last man  policy that was completely ineffective  ,[],[]
33,By the beginning of       Hitler had lost all initiative in the Soviet Union  and was struggling even to hold back the tide turning against him     From      to       the United States and Britain acted in only a limited manner in the European theater  much to the chagrin of Stalin  They drove out the Germans in Africa  invading Morocco and Algeria on November              ,"['the Soviet Union', 'the United States', 'Britain', 'European', 'Stalin', 'Germans', 'Africa', 'Morocco', 'Algeria', 'November              ']","['Morocco', 'Algeria']"
