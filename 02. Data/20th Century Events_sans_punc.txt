This    was    similar    to    how   /11    was    inciting    incident    of   st    century    .                 Bound    by    Slavic    nationalism    to    help    small    Serbian    state         Russians    came    to    aid    of    Serbs    when    they    were    attacked    .    Interwoven    alliances         an    increasing    arms    race         and    old    hatreds    dragged    Europe    into    war    .                 Allies         known    initially    as    ``    Triple    Entente   "  "        comprised    British    Empire         France         and    Russia    .    Germany         Austria-Hungary         Bulgaria         and    later    Ottoman    Empire         were    known    as    ``    Central    Powers   "  "   .                              In            Russia    ended    hostile    actions    against    Central    Powers    after    fall    of    Tsar    .    Bolsheviks    negotiated    Treaty    of    Brest-Litovsk    with    Germany         although    it    was    a    huge    cost    to    Russia    .    In    treaty         Bolshevik    Russia    ceded    Baltic    states    to    Germany         and    its    province    of    Kars    Oblast    in    South    Caucasus    to    Ottoman    Empire    .    It    also    recognized    independence    of    Ukraine    .                 Although    Germany    shifted    huge    forces    from    eastern    to    western    front    after    signing    treaty         it    was    unable    to    stop    Allied    advance         especially    with    entrance    of    the United Statesn    troops    in       .                 war    itself    was    also    a    chance    for    combatant    nations    to    show    off    their    military    strength    and    technological    ingenuity    .    Germans    introduced    machine    gun                      U-boats                 and    deadly    gases    .                 British    first    used    tank    .                 Both    sides    had    a    chance    to    test    out    their    new    aircraft    to    see    if    they    could    be    used    in    warfare    .    It    was    widely    believed    that    war    would    be    short    .    Unfortunately         since    trench    warfare    was    best    form    of    defense         advances    on    both    sides    were    very    slow    and    came    at    a    terrible    cost    to    lives    .                 Division    of    Austria-Hungary    after    World    War    IWhen    war    was    finally    over    in            results    would    set    stage    for    next    twenty    years    .    First    and    foremost         Germans    were    forced    to    sign    Treaty    of    Versailles         forcing    them    to    make    exorbitant    payments    to    repair    damages    caused    during    War    .    Many    Germans    felt    these    reparations    were    unfair    because    they    did    not    actually    ``    lose   "  "   war    nor    did    they    feel    they    caused    war         see    Stab-in-the-back    legend         .                 Germany    was    never    occupied    by    Allied    troops         yet    it    had    to    accept    a    liberal    democratic    government    imposed    on    it    by    victors    after    abdication    of    Kaiser    Wilhelm    .                 Much    of    map    of    Europe    was    redrawn    by    victors    based    upon    theory    that    future    wars    could    be    prevented    if    all    ethnic    groups    had    their    own    ``    homeland   "  "   .    New    states    like    Yugoslavia    and    Czechoslovakia    were    created    out    of    former    Austro-Hungarian    Empire    to    accommodate    nationalist    aspirations    of    these    groups    .                 An    international    body    called    League    of    Nations    was    formed    to    mediate    disputes    and    prevent    future    wars         although    its    effectiveness    was    severely    limited    by         among    other    things         its    reluctance    and    inability    to    act    .                 Russian    Revolution    and    Communism         edit         Main    article    :    Russian    RevolutionThe    Russian    Revolution    of            ending    in    overthrow    of    Tsarist    regime    and    execution    of    His    Imperial    Majesty    Nicholas    II    and    his    family         sparked    a    wave    of    communist    revolutions    across    Europe         prompting    many    to    believe    that    a    socialist    world    revolution    could    be    realized    in    near    future    .                 However         European    revolutions    were    defeated         Vladimir    Lenin    died    in            and    within    a    few    years         Joseph    Stalin    displaced    Leon    Trotsky    as    de    facto    leader    of    Soviet    Union    .    idea    of    worldwide    revolution    was    no    longer    in    forefront         as    Stalin    concentrated    on    ``    socialism    in    one    country   "  "                and    embarked    on    a    bold    plan    of    collectivization    and    industrialization    .                 majority    of    socialists    and    even    many    communists    became    disillusioned    with    Stalin   " s"   autocratic    rule         his    purges    and    assassination    of    his    ``    enemies   "  "        as    well    as    news    of    famines    he    imposed    on    his    own    people    .                 Communism    was    strengthened    as    a    force    in    Western    democracies    when    global    economy    crashed    in       in    what    became    known    as    Great    Depression    .    Many    people    saw    this    as    first    stage    of    end    of    capitalist    system    and    were    attracted    to    Communism    as    a    solution    to    economic    crisis         especially    as    Soviet    Union   " s"   economic    development    in   s    was    strong         unaffected    by    capitalist    world   " s"   crisis    .                 Between    wars         edit         Dorothea    Lange   " s"      photo    Migrant    Mother    is    one    of    most    iconic    photos    associated    with    Great    DepressionMain    article    :    Interwar    periodEconomic    depression         edit         Main    articles    :    Roaring    Twenties    and    Great    DepressionAfter    World    War    I         global    economy    remained    strong    through    most    of   s    .    war    had    provided    a    stimulus    for    industry    and    economic    activity    in    general    .    There    were    many    warning    signs    foretelling    Crash    of       of    global    economic    system    at    end    of    decade         that    were    generally    not    understood    by    political    leadership    of    time    .                 responses    to    crisis    often    made    situation    worse         as    millions    of    people    watched    their    savings    become    next    to    worthless         and    idea    of    a    steady    job    with    a    reasonable    income    fading    away    .                 Many    sought    answers    from    alternative    ideologies    such    as    communism    and    fascism    .                 They    believed    that    capitalist    economic    system    was    collapsing    and    that    new    ideas    were    required    to    meet    crisis    .    early    responses    to    crisis    were    based    on    assumption    that    free    market    would    correct    itself    .    This         however         did    very    little    to    correct    crisis    or    to    alleviate    suffering    of    many    ordinary    people    .    Thus         idea    that    existing    system    could    be    reformed    by    government    intervention    in    economy         rather    than    by    continuing    laissez-faire    approach         became    prominent    as    a    solution    to    crisis    .    Democratic    governments    assumed    responsibility    to    provide    needed    services    in    society         and    to    alleviate    poverty    .    Thus    was    born    welfare    state    .                 These    two    politico-economic    principles         belief    in    government    intervention    and    welfare    state         as    opposed    to    belief    in    free    market    and    private    institutions         would    define    many    political    battles    for    rest    of    century.The    rise    of    dictatorship         edit         Main    articles    :    Fascism         Totalitarianism         and    DictatorshipNazi    soldiers    hang    a    poster    on    window    of    Jewish-owned    business         that    says    :    ``    Germans         defend    yourselves    .    Do    not    buy    from    Jews   "  "   .    Germany        Fascism    first    appeared    in    Italy    with    rise    to    power    of    Benito    Mussolini    in       .                 ideology    was    supported    by    a    large    proportion    of    upper    classes    as    a    strong    challenge    to    threat    of    communism    .                 When    Adolf    Hitler    came    to    power    in    Germany    in            a    new    variant    of    fascism    called    Nazism    took    over    Germany    and    ended    German    experiment    with    democracy    .    Nazi    Party    in    Germany    was    dedicated    to    restoration    of    German    honor    and    prestige         unification    of    German-speaking    peoples         and    annexation    of    Central    and    Eastern    Europe    as    vassal    states         with    Slavic    population    to    act    as    slave    labor    to    serve    German    economic    interests    .                 There    was    also    a    strong    appeal    to    a    mythical    racial    purity         idea    that    Germans    were    Herrenvolk    or    ``    master    race   "  "             and    a    vicious    antisemitism    which    promoted    idea    of    Jews    as    subhuman         Untermensch         and    worthy    only    of    extermination    .                 Many    people    in    Western    Europe    and    United    States    greeted    rise    of    Hitler    with    relief    or    indifference    .                 They    could    see    nothing    wrong    with    a    strong    Germany    ready    to    take    on    communist    menace    to    east    .    Antisemitism    during    Great    Depression    was    widespread    as    many    were    content    to    blame    Jews    for    causing    economic    downturn    .                 Hitler    began    to    put    his    plan    in    motion         annexing    Austria    in    Anschluss         or    reunification    of    Austria    to    Germany         in       .                 He    then    negotiated    annexation    of    Sudetenland         a    German-speaking    mountainous    area    of    Czechoslovakia         in    Munich    Conference    .                 British    were    eager    to    avoid    war    and    believed    Hitler   " s"   assurance    to    protect    security    of    Czech    state    .    Hitler    annexed    rest    of    Czech    state    shortly    afterwards         indicating    that    he    had    ulterior    motives    .                 Fascism    was    not    only    form    of    dictatorship    to    rise    in    post-war    period    .    Almost    all    of    new    democracies    in    nations    of    Eastern    Europe    collapsed    and    were    replaced    by    authoritarian    regimes    .                 Spain    also    became    a    dictatorship    under    leadership    of    General    Francisco    Franco    after    Spanish    Civil    War    .                 Totalitarian    states    attempted    to    achieve    total    control    over    their    subjects    as    well    as    their    total    loyalty    .    They    held    state    above    individual         and    were    often    responsible    for    some    of    worst    acts    in    history         such    as    Holocaust    Adolf    Hitler    perpetrated    on    European    Jews         or    Great    Purge    Stalin    perpetrated    in    Soviet    Union    in   s.Global    war    :    World    War    II        –1945              edit         Main    article    :    World    War    IIThe    war    in    Europe         edit         Main    article    :    European    Theater    of    World    War    IIThis    section    provides    a    conversational    overview    of    World    War    II    in    Europe    .    See    main    article    for    a    fuller    discussion.The    signing    of    Molotov–Ribbentrop    Pact    in    Moscow         August           Soon    after    events    in    Czechoslovakia         the United Kingdom    and    France    issued    assurances    of    protection    to    Poland         which    seemed    to    be    next    on    Hitler   " s"   list    .    World    War    II    officially    began    on    September                    when    Hitler    unleashed    his    Blitzkrieg         or    lightning    war         against    Poland    .    the United Kingdom    and    France         much    to    Hitler   " s"   surprise         immediately    declared    war    upon    Germany         but    help    they    delivered    to    Poland    was    negligible    .                 Sixteen    days    later         Poland    was    attacked    from    East    by    Soviet    Union         acting    in    a    secret    alliance    with    Nazi    Germany    .                 After    only    a    few    weeks         Polish    forces    were    overwhelmed         and    its    government    fled    to    exile    in    London         see    Polish    government    in    Exile         .In    starting    World    War    II         Germans    had    unleashed    a    new    type    of    warfare         characterized    by    highly    mobile    forces    and    use    of    massed    aircraft    .    German    strategy    concentrated    upon    devotion    of    Wehrmacht         or    German    army         to    use    of    tank    groups         called    panzer    divisions         and    groups    of    mobile    infantry         in    concert    with    relentless    attacks    from    air    .    Encirclement    was    also    a    major    part    of    strategy    .    This    change    smashed    any    expectations    that    Second    World    War    would    be    fought    in    trenches    like    first    .                 As    Hitler   " s"   forces    conquered    Poland         Soviet    Union         under    General    Secretary    Joseph    Stalin         was    acting    out    guarantees    of    territory    under    a    secret    part    of    a    nonaggression    pact    between    the Soviet Union    and    Germany    known    as    Molotov–Ribbentrop    Pact    .    This    treaty    gave    Stalin    free    rein    to    take    Baltic    republics    of    Estonia         Latvia         and    Lithuania         as    well    as    Eastern    Poland         all    of    which    would    remain    in    Soviet    possession    after    war    .                 Stalin    also    launched    an    attack    on    Finland         which    he    hoped    to    reduce    to    little    more    than    a    Soviet    puppet    state         but    Red    Army    met    staunch    Finnish    resistance    in    what    became    known    as    Winter    War    and    succeeded    in    gaining    only    limited    territory    from    Finns    .                 This    action    would    later    cause    Finns    to    ally    with    Germany    when    its    attack    on    Soviet    Union    came    in       .                 Blitzkrieg         edit         After    defeat    of    Poland         a    period    known    as    Phony    War    ensued    during    winter    of   –1940         which    saw    only    limited    military    land    operation    on    Western    Front    .                 All    of    this    changed    on    May                    when    Germans    launched    a    massive    attack    on    Low    Countries         Belgium         Netherlands         and    Luxembourg              most    probably    to    surmount    Maginot    Line    of    defenses    on    Franco-German    border    .                 This    witnessed    incredible    fall    of    Eben    Emael         a    Belgian    fort    considered    impregnable    and    guarded    by       Belgians         to    a    force    of    only       German    paratroopers    .    worst    of    this    was    that    King    Leopold    III    of    Belgium    surrendered    to    Germans    on    May       without    warning    his    allies         exposing    entire    flank    of    Allied    forces    to    German    panzer    groups    .                 Following    conquest    of    Low    Countries         Hitler    occupied    Denmark    and    Norway         beginning    on    April               .    Norway    was    strategically    important    because    of    its    sea    routes    which    supplied    crucial    Swedish    ore    to    Nazi    war    machine    .    Norway    held    on    for    a    few    crucial    weeks         but    Denmark    surrendered    after    only    six    hours    .                              Sweden    was    only    Scandinavian    country    to    successfully    maintain    its    neutrality    throughout    war         with    occasional    breaches    of    neutrality    in    favor    of    both    Germany    and    Western    Allies    .                 With    disaster    in    Low    Countries         France         considered    at    time    to    have    had    finest    army    in    world         lasted    only    four    weeks         with    Paris    being    occupied    on    June       .    Three    days    later         Marshal    Philippe    Pétain    surrendered    to    Germans    .                 debacle    in    France    also    led    to    one    of    war   " s"   greatest    mysteries         and    Hitler   " s"   first    great    blunder         Dunkirk         where    a    third    of    a    million    trapped    British    and    French    soldiers    were    evacuated    by    not    only    British    war    boats         but    every    craft    army    could    find         including    fishing    boats    .    Hitler    refused    to    ``    risk   "  "   his    panzers    on    an    action    at    Dunkirk         listening    to    advice    of    Air    Minister    Hermann    Göring    and    allowing    Luftwaffe         or    German    Air    Force         to    handle    job    .                 irony    of    this    was    that    escaped    men    would    form    core    of    army    that    was    to    invade    beaches    of    Normandy    in       .    Hitler    did    not    occupy    all    of    France         but    about    three-quarters         including    all    of    Atlantic    coast         allowing    Marshal    Pétain    to    remain    as    dictator    of    an    area    known    as    Vichy    France    .                 However         members    of    escaped    French    Army    formed    around    General    Charles    de    Gaulle    to    create    Free    French    forces         which    would    continue    to    battle    Hitler    in    stead    of    an    independent    France    .                 At    this    moment         Italy         under    Benito    Mussolini         declared    war    on    Allies    on    June            thinking    that    war    was    almost    over         but    he    managed    only    to    occupy    a    few    hundred    yards    of    French    territory    .                 Throughout    war         Italians    would    be    more    of    a    burden    to    Nazis    than    a    boon         and    would    later    cost    them    precious    time    in    Greece    .                              German    Heinkel    He       bombers    during    Battle    of    the United KingdomHitler    now    turned    his    eyes    on    Great    the United Kingdom         which    stood    alone    against    him    .    He    ordered    his    generals    to    draw    up    plans    for    an    invasion         code    named    Operation    Sea    Lion         and    ordered    Luftwaffe    to    launch    a    massive    air    war    against    British    isles         which    would    come    to    be    known    as    Battle    of    the United Kingdom    .    British    at    first    suffered    steady    losses         but    eventually    managed    to    turn    air    war    against    Germany         taking    down       German    planes    throughout    summer    of       to    only       Royal    Air    Force         RAF         losses    .                 key    turning    point    came    when    Germans    discontinued    successful    attacks    against    British    airplane    factories    and    radar    command    and    coordination    stations    and    turned    to    civilian    bombing    known    as    terror    bombing    using    distinctive    ``    bomb   "  "   sound    created    by    German    dive-bomber         Stuka    .                 switch    came    after    a    small    British    bombing    force    had    attacked    Berlin    .                 Hitler    was    infuriated    .    However         his    decision    to    switch    attacks   " "   focus    allowed    British    to    rebuild    RAF    and    eventually    force    Germans    to    indefinitely    postpone    Sea    Lion    .                 importance    of    Battle    of    the United Kingdom    is    that    it    marked    first    of    Hitler   " s"   defeats         however    its    overall    impact    was    overshadowed    by    his    later    blunders    in    east    .    Secondly         it    marked    advent    of    radar    as    a    major    weapon    in    modern    air    war    .    With    radar         squadrons    of    fighters    could    be    quickly    assembled    to    respond    to    incoming    bombers    attempting    to    bomb    civilian    targets    .    It    also    allowed    identification    of    type    and    a    guess    at    number    of    incoming    enemy    aircraft         as    well    as    tracking    of    friendly    airplanes    .                 Operation    Barbarossa         edit         Hitler         taken    aback    by    his    defeat    over    skies    of    the United Kingdom         now    turned    his    gaze    eastward    to    Soviet    Union    .    Despite    having    signed    non-aggression    pact    with    Stalin         Hitler    despised    communism    and    wished    to    destroy    it    in    land    of    its    birth    .    He    originally    planned    to    launch    attack    in    early    spring    of       to    avoid    disastrous    Russian    winter    .    However         a    pro-allied    coup    in    Yugoslavia    and    Mussolini   " s"   almost    utter    defeat    in    his    invasion    of    Greece    from    occupied    Albania    prompted    Hitler    to    launch    a    personal    campaign    of    revenge    in    Yugoslavia    and    to    occupy    Greece    at    same    time    .                 Greeks    would    have    a    bitter    revenge    of    sorts    ;    attack    caused    a    delay    of    several    crucial    weeks    of    invasion    of    the Soviet Union         potentially    hampering    it    .                 Europe    at    height    of    German    control    in   On    June                    Hitler    attacked    Stalin    with    largest    army    world    had    ever    seen    .    Over    three    million    men    and    their    weapons    were    put    into    service    against    Soviet    Union    .                 Stalin    had    been    warned    about    attack         both    by    other    countries    and    by    his    own    intelligence    network         but    he    had    refused    to    believe    it    .    Therefore         Soviet    army    was    largely    unprepared    and    suffered    massive    setbacks    in    early    part    of    war         despite    Stalin   " s"   orders    to    counterattack    Germans    .                 Throughout            German    forces         divided    into       army    groups         Army    Group    A         Army    Group    B         and    Army    Group    C              occupied    territories    of    present    day    Ukraine    and    Belarus         laid    siege    to    Leningrad         present    day    Saint    Petersburg              and    advanced    to    within       miles    of    Moscow    .    At    this    critical    moment         Soviet    people    stalled    German    Wehrmacht    to    a    halt    at    gates    of    Moscow    .    Stalin    had    planned    to    evacuate    city         and    had    already    moved    important    government    functions         but    decided    to    stay    and    rally    city    .    Recently    arrived    troops    from    east    under    command    of    Marshal    Georgy    Zhukov    counterattacked    Germans    and    drove    them    from    Moscow    .                 Mussolini    had    launched    an    offensive    in    North    Africa    from    Italian-controlled    Libya    into    British-controlled    Egypt    .    However         British    smashed    Italians    and    were    on    verge    of    taking    Libya    .    Hitler    decided    to    help    by    sending    in    a    few    thousand    troops         a    Luftwaffe    division         and    first-rate    general    Erwin    Rommel    .                 Rommel    managed    to    use    his    small    force    to    repeatedly    smash    massively    superior    British    forces    and    to    recapture    port    city    of    Tobruk    and    advance    into    Egypt    .    However         Hitler         embroiled    in    his    invasion    of    Soviet    Union         refused    to    send    Rommel    any    more    troops         causing    Rommel    to    retreat    and    preventing    him    from    seizing    Middle    East         where    Axis-friendly    regimes    had    taken    root    in    Iraq    and    Persia         present-day    Iran         .                              After    winter         Hitler    launched    a    fresh    offensive    in    spring    of            with    aim    of    capturing    oil-rich    Caucacus    and    city    of    Stalingrad    .    However         he    repeatedly    switched    his    troops    to    where    they    were    not    needed    .    offensive    bogged    down         and    entire   th    Army         considered    best    of    German    troops         was    trapped    in    Stalingrad    .    Hitler    now    refused    to    let   th    Army    break    out    .    He    insisted    that    German    army    would    force    its    way    in    .    Hermann    Göring    also    assured    Hitler    that    Luftwaffe    could    supply   th    Army    adequately         when    it    could    in    reality    only    supply    a    minute    fraction    of    needed    ammunition    and    rations    .    Eventually         starved   th    Army    surrendered         dealing    a    severe    blow    to    Germans    .    In    end         defeat    at    Stalingrad    was    turning    point    for    war    in    east    .                 Meanwhile         Japanese    had    attacked    United    States    at    Pearl    Harbor    in    Hawaii    on    December               .    This    disastrous    attack    forced    the United Statesns    into    war    .    Parts    of    German    brass    advised    against    declaring    war    on    the United States         arguing    that    since    Japan    was    aggressor         Tripartite    Pact    did   "n t"   bind    Germany    to    do    so    .    However         Hitler    hoped    that    Japan    would    be    able    to    quickly    defeat    the United States    and    then    turn    its    attention    on    helping    effort    against    Russia    .    Both    Germany    and    Italy    declared    war    on    United    States    a    few    days    after    attack    .                 Turning    tides         edit         A    British    soldier    gives    a    V    gesture    to    German    prisoners    captured    at    El    Alamein            October   Throughout    rest    of       and            Soviets    began    to    gain    ground    against    Germans    after    some    victories    like    tank    battle    of    Kursk    .                 By    this    time         Rommel    had    been    forced    to    abandon    North    Africa    after    a    defeat    by    Montgomery    at    El    Alamein    in    what    was    first    decisive    victory    of    Allies    over    Germany    army         leading    Churchill    to    declare    it    ``    end    of    beginning   "  "   .                 On    several    fronts         Wehrmacht    had    encountered    serious    casualties    that    it    could    not    replace    .    Hitler    also    insisted    on    a    ``    hold    at    all    costs   "  "   policy    which    forbade    relinquishing    any    ground    .    He    followed    a    ``    fight    to    last    man   "  "   policy    that    was    completely    ineffective    .    By    beginning    of            Hitler    had    lost    all    initiative    in    Soviet    Union         and    was    struggling    even    to    hold    back    tide    turning    against    him    .                 From       to            United    States    and    the United Kingdom    acted    in    only    a    limited    manner    in    European    theater         much    to    chagrin    of    Stalin    .    They    drove    out    Germans    in    Africa         invading    Morocco    and    Algeria    on    November               .                 Then         on    July                    Allies    invaded    Sicily         in    preparation    for    an    advance    through    Italy         ``    soft    underbelly   "  "   of    Axis         as    Winston    Churchill    called    it    .    On    September            invasion    of    Italy    began    .                 By    winter    of            southern    half    of    Italy    was    in    Allied    hands    .    Italians         most    of    whom    did    not    really    support    war         had    already    turned    against    Mussolini    .    In    July         he    had    been    stripped    of    power    and    taken    prisoner         though    Italians    feigned    continued    support    of    Axis    .    On    September            Italians    formally    surrendered                      but    most    of    Italy    not    in    Allied    hands    was    controlled    by    German    troops    and    those    loyal    to    Mussolini   " s"        Mussolini    had    been    freed    by    German    paratroopers         new    Italian    Social    Republic         which    in    reality    consisted    of    shrinking    zone    of    German    control    .    Germans    offered    staunch    resistance         but    by    June                    Rome    had    fallen    .                 Battle    of    Atlantic    took    place    from       to       and    was    described    as    ``    longest         largest         and    most    complex    naval    battle    in    history   "  "   .                 Germans    hoped    to    sever    vital    supply    lines    between    the United Kingdom    and    the United States         sinking    many    tons    of    shipping    with    U-boats         German    submarines    .    However         development    of    destroyer    and    aircraft    with    a    longer    patrol    range    were    effective    at    countering    U-boat    threat    and    by    December            Germans    had    lost    battle    .                 Operation    Overlord         edit         On    June                    Western    Allies    finally    launched    long-awaited    assault    on    ``    Fortress    Europe   "  "   so    wanted    by    Stalin    .    offensive         codenamed    Operation    Overlord         began    early    morning    hours    of    June       .    day         known    as    D-day         was    marked    by    foul    weather    .    Rommel         who    was    now    in    charge    of    defending    France    against    possible    Allied    attack         thought    Allies    would    not    attack    during    stormy    weather         and    was    on    holiday    in    Germany    .                 Besides    this         Germans    were    expecting    an    attack         but    at    natural    harbor    of    Calais    and    not    beaches    of    Normandy    ;    They    did    not    know    about    Allies   " "   artificial    harbours         and    false    leads    planted    by    Allies    suggested    Calais    as    landing    site.                 U.S    .    assault    troops    approaching    Omaha    Beach            June   .By    this    time         war    was    looking    ever    darker    for    Germany    .    On    July                    a    group    of    conspiring    German    officers    attempted    to    assassinate    Hitler    .    bomb    they    used    did    injure    him         but    second    was    not    used         and    a    table    shielded    Hitler    in    a    stroke    of    luck    .                 plotters    still    could    have    launched    a    coup         but    only    head    of    occupied    Paris    acted         arresting    SS    and    Gestapo    forces    in    city    .    German    propaganda    minister         Joseph    Goebbels         rallied    Nazis    and    hunted    down    conspirators         arresting    up    to       people    in    wake    of    plot         according    to    some    estimates    .                 In    France         Allies    took    Normandy    and    finally    Paris    on    August       .                 In    east         Soviets    had    advanced    almost    to    former    Polish-Soviet    border    .    At    this    time         Hitler    introduced    V-weapons         V-1    flying    bomb    and         later         V-2         first    rockets    used    in    modern    warfare    .    V-1    was    often    intercepted    by    air    pilots         but    V-2    was    extremely    fast    and    carried    a    large    payload    .    However         this    advance    came    too    late    in    war    to    have    any    real    effect    .                 Germans    were    also    on    verge    of    introducing    a    number    of    terrifying    new    weapons         including    advanced    jet    aircraft         which    were    too    fast    for    ordinary    propeller    aircraft         and    submarine    improvements    which    would    allow    Germans    to    again    fight    effectively    in    Atlantic    .    All    this    came    too    late    to    save    Hitler    .    Although    a    September    invasion    of    Netherlands    failed         Allies    made    steady    advances    .    In    winter    of            Hitler    put    everything    into    one    last    desperate    gamble    in    West         known    as    Battle    of    Bulge         which         despite    an    initial    advance         was    a    failure         because    introduction    of    new    Allied    tanks    and    low    troop    numbers    among    Germans    prevented    any    real    action    being    taken    .    Nevertheless         it    was    one    of    bloodiest    battles    of    war    and    second    costliest    battle    in    history    of    the United Statesn    Army    .                 Final    days         edit         In    early    February            three    Allied    leaders         Franklin    Roosevelt         Winston    Churchill         and    Joseph    Stalin         met    at    newly    liberated    Yalta    in    Crimea    in    Soviet    Union    in    Yalta    Conference    .                 Here         they    agreed    upon    a    plan    to    divide    post-war    Europe    .    Most    of    east    went    to    Stalin         who    agreed    to    allow    free    elections    in    Eastern    Europe         which    he    never    did    .    west    went    to    the United Kingdom         France         and    the United States    Post-war    Germany    would    be    split    between    four         as    would    Berlin    .    This    division    of    spheres    of    influence    would    set    up    international    diplomacy    for    Cold    War    that    would    dominate    second    half    of    century    .                 At    beginning    of            Hitler    was    on    his    last    strings    .    Soviets    launched    a    devastating    attack    from    Poland    into    Germany    and    Eastern    Europe         intending    to    take    Berlin    .    Germans    collapsed    in    West         allowing    Allies    to    fan    out    across    Germany    .    However         Supreme    Allied    Commander         the United Statesn    general    Dwight    D.    Eisenhower         refused    to    strike    for    Berlin         and    instead    became    obsessed    with    reports    of    possible    guerrilla    activity    in    southern    Germany         which    in    reality    existed    mainly    in    propaganda    of    Joseph    Goebbels    .                 By    April            Soviets    had    besieged    Berlin    .    Hitler    remained    in    city    in    a    bunker    under    Chancellery    garden    .    On    April            he    committed    suicide    by    shooting    himself         after    a    ritual    wedding    with    his    longtime    mistress    Eva    Braun    .                 Germans    held    out    another       days    under    Admiral    Doenitz         their    new    leader         but    Germans    surrendered    unconditionally    on    May                    ending    war    in    Europe         see    V-E    Day         .                 Rivalries    that    had    begun    during    war         combined    with    sense    of    strength    in    victorious    powers         laid    foundations    of    Iron    Curtain    and    of    Cold    War.The    war    in    Pacific         edit         Main    article    :    Asiatic-Pacific    TheaterBackground         edit         first    event    that    is    usually    linked    to    later    Pacific    conflict    was    Mukden    Incident    of       September            during    which    Japanese    military    staged    bombing    of    South    Manchuria    Railway    and    pinned    blame    on    Chinese    dissidents    .                 Japan    then    used    this    as    pretext    to    invade    northeastern    China    next    day    and    turn    region    of    Manchuria    into    Japanese    puppet    state    of    Manchukuo    .                 After    League    of    Nations    commissioned       Lytton    Report         which    exposed    Mukden    Incident    as    a    Japanese    ruse         Japan    was    left    internationally    isolated         withdrawing    from    League    of    Nations    in    March       .    In       Manchukuo    became    a    constitutional    monarchy    and    former    Chinese    Emperor    Pu    Yi    was    placed    on    throne         despite    real    power    being    held    by    Japan    .                 Despite    relations    between    Japan    and    China    suffering    because    occupation    of    Manchuria         situation    did    not    turn    into    all-out    war    until       July            when    a    dispute    between    Chinese    and    Japanese    soldiers    turned    into    a    battle    during    Marco    Polo    Bridge    Incident    .                 This         in    turn         led    to    a    further    escalation    of    hostilities         leading    to    Second    Sino-Japanese    War         one    of    deadliest    conflicts    in    human    history    .                 Japan    enjoyed    some    early    major    victories         capturing    both    Shanghai    and    Chinese    capital    of    Nanjing    in       and    forcing    Chinese    central    government   " s"   relocation    to    Chongqing    .    Following    Chinese    victories    in    Changsha    and    Guangxi    in            war    reached    somewhat    of    a    stalemate         with    Japan    controlling    large    cities         but    being    unable    to    rule    vast    countryside    .                 On       September            Japan    became    cosignatories    of    Tripartite    Pact         joining    a    military    alliance    with    Germany    and    Italy    .

On       February            Japan    also    launched    a    devastating    aerial    attack    on    Australian    city    of    Darwin         in    what    was    first    attack    by    a    foreign    power    on    Australian    soil    .                 turning    of    tide    came    in    early    May         during    Battle    of    Coral    Sea         which    proved    first    strategic    victory    of    Allies    against    Japanese    expansion    .                 This    was    followed    one    month    later    by    Battle    of    Midway         in    which    the United States    Navy    defeated    an    attacking    Japanese    fleet         inflicting    devastating    damage    on    attacking    force    .    Battle    of    Midway    is    widely    considered    most    important    naval    battle    of    Pacific    Campaign    and    has    even    been    described    as    ``    most    stunning    and    decisive    blow    in    history    of    naval    warfare   "  "                reasons    usually    given    for    resounding    victory    are    Japanese    overconfidence    in    their    own    forces         poor    planning    and    intercepting    of    Japanese    battle    plans    by    United    States    .                 losses    suffered    during    this    Battle    of    Midway         paired    with    campaign    of    attrition    that    was    taking    place    in    Solomon    Islands         left    Japan    unable    to    replenish    its    forces    and    turned    tides    of    war    against    it    .    By    August            Allied    forces    were    on    offensive         earning    victories    in    New    Guinea    campaign    at    Guadalcanal         Milne    Bay    and    Buna-Gona    .                 Allied    offensive         edit         A    map    of    Japanese    advance    from       to   Over    next    two    years    Allies    slowly    captured    one    island    base    after    another         trying    to    get    closer    to    Japan    itself         where    it    planned    to    launch    massive    strategic    air    attacks    and         only    if    absolutely    necessary         execute    a    ground    invasion    .    By    July            the United States    recaptured    Guam    and    captured    Tinian         which    finally    put    them    in    attacking    range    of    mainland    Japan    using    new    Boeing    B-29    bombers    .                 Despite    advances    of    Allies         massive    fighting    was    still    taking    place         both    in    South-East    Asia    with    Japanese    offensive    in    India    and    in    Pacific         with    Battle    of    Philippine    Sea         where    Japan    suffered    major    losses    and    definitively    lost    ability    to    rely    on    aircraft    carriers    .                 In    later    October         a    combined    attack    of    the United Statesn    and    Australian    forces    took    on    Imperial    Japanese    Navy    during    Battle    of    Leyte    Gulf    in    what    was    to    be    largest    naval    battle    of    World    War    II    and    possibly    largest    naval    battle    of    all    time    .                 Allied    victory    achieved    its    stated    goal    of    further    severing    oil    supplied    to    Japanese    army         which    was    already    struggling    to    fuel    remainder    of    its    naval    power    .                 battle    of    Leyte    Gulf    is    also    notable    as    first    battle    in    which    Japanese    aircraft    carried    out    organized    kamikaze    attacks    .                 By    early            the United Statesns    set    their    eyes    on    Japanese    island    of    Iwo    Jima         which    was    of    great    strategic    importance         being    situated    halfway    between    Tokyo    and    Mariana    Islands    .    Capturing    island    meant    not    only    a    better    launch    station    for    aerial    attacks    against    mainland    Japan         but    also    prevention    of    its    use    as    an    early-warning    station    against    air    raids    .    Japanese    were    expecting    an    attack    and    have    been    heavily    fortifying    entire    island    for    over    a    year    .                 Despite    the United Statesn    troops    outnumbering    Japanese    to    a    rate    of    more    than       to            the United StatesA    suffered    heavy    casualties    in       days    of    fighting         with    over       Marines    killed    and    another       wounded                      leading    some    historians    to    question    strategic    worth    of    action    .                 With    Japan    struggling    to    defend    homeland    islands         counteroffensives    in    other    parts    of    Japanese    Empire    became    more    feasible         with    important    battles    taking    place    in    Burma         Borneo    and    China.Continuing    to    come    nearer    main    Japanese    islands         on       April       the United States    Marines    mounted    largest    amphibious    assault    of    Pacific    Theater    on    island    of    Okinawa    .                 After    a    long    campaign    of    island    hopping         Allies    were    planning    to    use    Kadena    Air    Base    on    large    island    of    Okinawa    as    a    base    for    Operation    Downfall         planned    invasion    of    Japanese    home    islands    which    were    only       miles    away    .                 battle    was    one    of    bloodiest    in    Pacific         with    approximately       casualties    on    both    sides    :    at    least       Allied    and   –117    Japanese    .

Despite    a    devastating    campaign    of    fire-bombing    in    Tokyo    and    dozens    of    other    cities         Japanese    showed    no    sign    of    planning    to    surrender    .    Following    Potsdam    Declaration    of    July            where    Allies    threatened    ``    prompt    and    utter    destruction   "  "   should    Japan    not    surrender                      decision    was    made    to    resort    to    first    use    of    atomic    bombs    .

Several    differing    views    exist    regarding    whether    it    was    intended    to    occur    from    war   " s"   beginning         or    if    plans    for    it    came    about    later    .                              Regardless         persecution    of    Jews    extended    well    before    war    even    started         such    as    in    Kristallnacht         literally    ``    Crystal    Night   "  "        Night    of    Broken    Glass         .                 Nazis    used    propaganda    to    great    effect    to    stir    up    antisemitic    feelings    within    ordinary    Germans    .    Many    people         including    politicians    and    historians         consider    Holocaust    to    be    worst    event    in    history         and    have    described    Hitler         his    followers         and    his    regime    as    evil.Slave    laborers    at    Buchenwald    concentration    camp.After    conquest    of    Poland         Third    Reich         which    had    previously    deported    Jews    and    other    ``    undesirables   "  "        suddenly    had    within    its    borders    largest    concentration    of    Jews    in    world    .    solution    was    to    round    up    Jews    and    place    them    in    Nazi    concentration    camps    or    in    ghettos         cordoned    off    sections    of    cities    where    Jews    were    forced    to    live    in    deplorable    conditions         often    with    tens    of    thousands    starving    to    death         and    bodies    decaying    in    streets    .                              As    appalling    as    this    sounds         they    were    lucky    ones    .    After    invasion    of    Soviet    Union         armed    killing    squads    of    SS    men    known    as    Einsatzgruppen    systematically    rounded    up    Jews    and    murdered    an    estimated    one    million    Jews    within    country    .                 As    barbaric    and    inhuman    as    this    seems         it    was    too    slow    and    inefficient    by    Nazi    standards.In            top    leadership    met    in    Wannsee         a    suburb    of    Berlin         and    began    to    plan    a    more    efficient    way    to    slaughter    Jews    .                 Nazis    created    a    system    of    extermination    camps    throughout    Poland         and    began    rounding    up    Jews    from    Soviet    Union         and    from    Ghettos    .                              Not    only    were    Jews    shot    or    gassed    to    death    en    masse         but    they    were    forced    to    provide    slave    labor    and    they    were    used    in    horrific    medical    experiments         see    Human    experimentation    in    Nazi    Germany         .                 Out    of    widespread    condemnation    of    Nazis   " "   medical    experiments         Nuremberg    Code    of    medical    ethics    was    devised    .                 Nazis    took    a    sadistic    pleasure    in    death    camps    ;    entrance    to    most    notorious    camp         Auschwitz         stated    ``    Arbeit    Macht    Frei   "  "   —   "  "   Work    Sets    You    Free   "  "   .

An    additional    several    million    Soviet    and    other    Allied    prisoners    of    war    died    in    camps    and    holding    areas    .                              There    is    some    controversy    over    whether    ordinary    Germans    knew    about    Holocaust    .                 It    appears    that    many    Germans    knew    about    concentration    camps    ;    such    things    were    prominently    displayed    in    magazines    and    newspapers    .                 In    many    places         Jews    had    to    walk    past    towns    and    villages    on    their    way    to    work    as    slaves    in    German    industry    .    In    any    case         Allied    soldiers    reported    that    smell    of    camps    carried    for    miles    .                 A    very    small    number    of    people    deny    Holocaust    occurred    entirely         though    these    claims    have    been    routinely    discredited    by    mainstream    historians    .                 Nuclear    Age    begins         edit         Main    article    :    History    of    nuclear    weaponsDuring   s         innovations    in    physics    made    it    apparent    that    it    could    be    possible    to    develop    nuclear    weapons    of    incredible    power    using    nuclear    reactions    .                 When    World    War    II    broke    out         scientists    and    advisors    among    Allies    feared    that    Nazi    Germany    may    have    been    trying    to    develop    its    own    atomic    weapons         and    United    States    and    United    Kingdom    pooled    their    efforts    in    what    became    known    as    Manhattan    Project    to    beat    them    to    it    .    At    secret    Los    Alamos    laboratory    in    New    Mexico         scientist    Robert    Oppenheimer    led    a    team    of    world   " s"   top    scientists    to    develop    first    nuclear    weapons         first    of    which    was    tested    at    Trinity    site    in    July       .                 However         Germany    had    surrendered    in    May            and    it    had    been    discovered    that    German    atomic    bomb    program    had    not    been    very    close    to    success    .                 first    nuclear    explosion         named    ``    Trinity   "  "        was    detonated    on    July           .The    Allied    team    produced    two    nuclear    weapons    for    use    in    war         one    powered    by    uranium-235    and    other    by    plutonium    as    fissionable    material         named    ``    Little    Boy   "  "   and    ``    Fat    Man   "  "   .                 These    were    dropped    on    Japanese    cities    of    Hiroshima    and    Nagasaki    on    August       and               each    .    This         in    combination    with    Soviet    invasion    of    Japanese-controlled    territory         convinced    Japanese    government    to    surrender    unconditionally    .    These    two    weapons    remain    only    two    nuclear    weapons    ever    used    against    other    countries    in    war    .                 Nuclear    weapons    brought    an    entirely    new    and    terrifying    possibility    to    warfare    of    nuclear    annihilation         because    it    was    feared    that    they    would    bring    about    human    extinction    overnight    .    While    at    first    United    States    held    a    monopoly    on    production    of    nuclear    weapons         Soviet    Union         with    some    assistance    from    espionage         managed    to    detonate    its    first    weapon         dubbed    ``    Joe-1   "  "   by    West         in    August       .                              post-war    relations    between    two         which    had    already    been    deteriorating         began    to    rapidly    disintegrate    .    Soon    two    were    locked    in    a    massive    stockpiling    of    nuclear    weapons    .    United    States    began    a    crash    program    to    develop    first    hydrogen    bomb    in            and    detonated    its    first    thermonuclear    weapon    in       .    This    new    weapon    was    alone    over       times    as    powerful    as    weapons    used    against    Japan    .    Soviet    Union    detonated    a    primitive    thermonuclear    weapon    in       and    a    full-fledged    one    in       .                 Nuclear    missiles    and    computerized    launch    systems    increased    range    and    scope    of    possible    nuclear    war.The    conflict    continued    to    escalate         with    major    superpowers    developing    long-range    missiles         such    as    ICBM         and    a    nuclear    strategy    which    guaranteed    that    any    use    of    nuclear    weapons    would    be    suicide    for    attacking    nation         Mutually    Assured    Destruction         .    creation    of    early    warning    systems    put    control    of    these    weapons    into    hands    of    newly    created    computers         and    they    served    as    a    tense    backdrop    throughout    Cold    War    .                 Since   s    there    were    concerns    about    rising    proliferation    of    nuclear    weapons    to    new    countries         which    was    seen    as    being    destabilizing    to    international    relations         spurring    regional    arms    races         and    generally    increasing    likelihood    of    some    form    of    nuclear    war    .    Eventually         nine    nations    would    overtly    develop    nuclear    weapons         and    still    maintain    stockpiles    today    :    United    States         Soviet    Union         and    later    Russia    would    inherit    these              United    Kingdom         France         China         India         Pakistan         Israel    and    North    Korea    .                 South    Africa    developed    six    crude    weapons    in   s         which    it    later    dismantled                           and    Israel    almost    certainly    developed    nuclear    weapons    though    it    never    confirmed    nor    denied    it    .                 creation    of    Nuclear    Non-proliferation    Treaty    in       was    an    attempt    to    curtail    such    proliferation                      but    a    number    of    countries    developed    nuclear    weapons    since    it    was    signed         and    many    did    not    sign    it              and    several    other    countries         including    Libya    and    Iran    were    suspected    of    having    clandestine    nuclear    weapons    programs    .                              post-war    world         edit         Main    article    :    Post–World    War    II    economic    expansionFollowing    World    War    II         majority    of    industrialized    world    lay    in    ruins    as    a    result    of    aerial    bombings         naval    bombardment         and    protracted    land    campaigns    .    United    States    was    a    notable    exception    to    this    ;    barring    Pearl    Harbor    and    some    minor    incidents         the United States    had    suffered    no    attacks    upon    its    territory    .                 United    States    and    Soviet    Union         which         despite    devastation    of    its    most    populated    areas         rebuilt    quickly         found    themselves    world   " s"   two    dominant    superpowers    .                 Much    of    Western    Europe    was    rebuilt    after    war    with    assistance    from    Marshall    Plan    .    Germany         chief    instigator    of    war         was    placed    under    joint    military    occupation    by    United    States         Great    the United Kingdom         France         and    Soviet    Union    .    Berlin         although    in    Soviet-controlled    territory         was    also    divided    among    four    powers    .                 Occupation    of    Berlin    would    continue    until       .    Japan    was    also    placed    under    the United States    occupation         that    would    last    seven    years         until       .                 Oddly         these    two    Axis    powers         despite    military    occupation         soon    rose    to    become    second         Japan         and    third         West    Germany         most    powerful    economies    in    world    .                 Following    end    of    war         Allies    famously    prosecuted    numerous    German    officials    for    war    crimes    and    other    offenses    in    Nuremberg    Trials    .    Although    Adolf    Hitler    had    committed    suicide         many    of    his    cronies         including    Hermann    Göring         were    convicted    .    Less    well-known    trials    of    other    Axis    officials    also    occurred         including    Tokyo    War    Crime    Trial    .                 failure    of    League    of    Nations    to    prevent    World    War    II    essentially    discredited    organization         and    it    was    dissolved    .                 A    new    attempt    at    world    peace    was    begun    with    founding    of    United    Nations    on    October                    in    San    Francisco    .

Immediately    after    war         European    powers    began    a    decades-long    process    of    withdrawing    from    their    possessions    in    Africa    and    Asia.In    India         Mahatma    Gandhi    became    a    global    icon    for    his    non-violent    struggle    to    achieve    Indian    independence    whereas    Mohamed    Ali    Jinnah    advocated    for    independence    of    a    separate    state    for    Muslims    .    This    was    achieved    in       with    end    of    British    rule    in    India    and    Partition    of    territory    into    modern    day    India    and    Pakistan         which    would    later    also    further    divide         leading    to    creation    of    People   " s"   Republic    of    Bangladesh    in       .                              Elsewhere    in    Asia         United    States    granted    independence    to    Philippines         its    major    Pacific    possession    in       .                 In    French    Indochina         armed    insurrections    forced    French    out    in    early   s         leading    to    formation    of    Laos         Cambodia    and    Vietnam    .                 In    Africa         nationalists    such    as    Jomo    Kenyatta    of    Kenya    and    Kwame    Nkrumah    of    Ghana    led    their    respective    nations    to    independence    from    foreign    rule    .                 Mere    decades    before         British    Empire    controlled    almost    half    of    continent         but    by            only    British    possession    in    Africa    was    Seychelles         which    would    also    become    independent    in            .    Between       and            almost       African    countries    achieved    their    independence    from    France    .                 Through    efforts    of    Amílcar    Cabral    and    others         Portuguese    colonies    of    Guinea-Bissau         Cape    Verde         Angola         Mozambique    and    São    Tomé    and    Príncipe    followed    suit    and    achieved    independence    during    mid-1970s         in    what    was    to    be    last    important    wave    of    African    decolonization    .                 In            there    were       member    states    in    United    Nations         but    as    newly    independent    nations    joined    organization         by       membership    increased    to       .                 emergence    of    newly    independent    countries    in    Africa    and    Asia    that    used    borders    of    imperial    partitions    later    led    to    further    conflict    .                 In    many    cases    this    meant    that    historically    antagonistic    ethnic    or    religious    groups    now    needed    to    share    same    country    or    that    several    nations    held    territorial    claims    over    regions    which    were    more    or    less    arbitrarily    divided    by    European    powers    .                              Some    conflicts    which    aroused    from    these    tensions         especially    Nigerian    Civil    War         Second    Congo    War         Second    Sudanese    Civil    War    and    Bangladesh    Liberation    War    have    been    among    bloodiest    wars    of   th    century    .

In    March            Winston    Churchill    gave    a    now    famous    speech    while    visiting    Westminster    College    in    the United States    which    is    usually    credited    as    first    use    of    term    iron    curtain    to    refer    to    separation    of    Soviet    and    Western    areas    of    influence    in    Europe    :                 From    Stettin    in    Baltic    to    Trieste    in    Adriatic    an    iron    curtain    has    descended    across    Continent    .

Eastern    Poland         incorporated    into    Byelorussian    SSR    and    Ukrainian    SSR                           Latvia         which    became    Latvian    SSR              Estonia         which    became    Estonian    SSR              Lithuania         which    became    Lithuanian    SSR                           part    of    eastern    Finland         which    became    Karelo-Finnish    SSR                      and    eastern    Romania         part    of    which    became    Moldavian    SSR                      were    now    wholly    part    of    Soviet    Union    .

North    Korea   " s"   invasion    of    South    Korea    on    June               led    to    United    Nations    intervention    .                 General    Douglas    MacArthur    led    troops    from    United    States         Canada         Australia         Great    the United Kingdom         and    other    countries    in    repulsing    Northern    invasion    .    However         war    reached    a    stalemate    after    Chinese    intervention    pushed    U.N.    forces    back         and    an    Armistice    ended    hostilities    in    July            leaving    two    Koreas    divided    and    tense    for    rest    of    century    .                 second    war         Vietnam    War         was    perhaps    third    most    visible    war    of   th    century         after    World    War    I    and    World    War    II    .    After    French    withdrawal    from    its    former    colony         on       July            Vietnam    became    partitioned    into    two    halves         much    like    Korea         along   th    parallel    .    Fighting    between    North    and    South    eventually    escalated    into    a    regional    war    .    United    States    provided    aid    to    South    Vietnam                 and    contributed    to    propaganda    efforts    against    North                      but    was    not    directly    involved    until    Gulf    of    Tonkin    Resolution         passed    in    reaction    to    a    supposed    North    Vietnamese    attack    upon    the United Statesn    destroyers         brought    the United States    into    war    as    a    belligerent    .                 war    was    initially    viewed    as    a    fight    to    contain    communism         see    containment         Truman    Doctrine         and    Domino    Theory              but         as    more    the United Statesns    were    drafted    and    news    of    events    such    as    Tet    Offensive    and    My    Lai    massacre    leaked    out         the United Statesn    sentiment    turned    against    war    .                              the United States    President    Richard    Nixon    was    elected    partially    on    a    promise    to    end    war    .    This    Nixon    Doctrine    involved    a    gradual    pullout    of    the United Statesn    forces    ;    South    Vietnamese    units    were    supposed    to    replace    them         backed    up    by    the United Statesn    air    power    .    plan    went    awry         with    Nixon    deliberately    sabotaging    peace    talks    for    political    gain                      and    war    spilled    into    neighboring    Cambodia    while    South    Vietnamese    forces    were    pushed    further    back    .                 Eventually         the United States    and    North    Vietnam    signed    Paris    Peace    Accords         ending    the United States    involvement    in    war    .                 With    threat    of    the United States    retaliation    gone         North    proceeded    to    violate    ceasefire    and    invaded    South    with    full    military    force    .    Saigon    was    captured    on    April                    and    Vietnam    was    unified    under    Communist    rule    a    year    later         effectively    bringing    an    end    to    one    of    most    unpopular    wars    of    all    time    .                              Cuban    Missile    Crisis    illustrates    just    how    close    to    brink    of    nuclear    war    world    came    during    Cold    War    .    Cuba         under    Fidel    Castro   " s"   socialist    government         had    formed    close    ties    with    Soviet    Union    .                 This    was    obviously    disquieting    to    United    States         given    Cuba   " s"   proximity    .    When    Lockheed    U-2    spy    plane    flights    over    island    revealed    that    Soviet    missile    launchers    were    being    installed         the United States    President    John    F.    Kennedy    instituted    a    naval    blockade    and    publicly    confronted    Soviet    Union    .    After    a    tense    week         Soviet    Union    backed    down    and    ordered    launchers    removed         not    wanting    to    risk    igniting    a    new    world    war    .                              space    race         edit         In            humans    first    set    foot    on    Moon.Main    article    :    Space    RaceWith    Cold    War    tensions    running    high         Soviet    Union    and    United    States    took    their    rivalry    to    stars    in       with    Soviet    launch    of    Sputnik    .                 A    ``    space    race   "  "   between    two    powers    followed    .                 the Soviet Union    reached    several    important    milestones         such    as    first    craft    on    Moon         Luna                         and    first    human    in    space         Yuri    Gagarin         .                 the United States    pulled    ahead    eventually    with    its    Mercury         Gemini         and    Apollo    programs         which    culminated    in    Apollo       astronauts    landing    on    Moon    on       July       .                 Five    more    landings    with    astronauts    followed         Apollo       was    forced    to    abort    its    mission         .                 Nevertheless         despite    its    successes         the United States    space    program    could    not    match    many    major    achievements    of    Soviet    space    program         such    as    rover-based    space    exploration    and    image    and    video    transfer    from    surface    of    another    planet         until    early   st    century    .                              In    addition         both    countries    launched    numerous    probes    into    space         such    as    Venera       and    Voyager       .                 In    later    decades         space    became    a    somewhat    friendlier    place    .    Regular    space    flights    with    astronauts    were    made    possible    with    the United Statesn    Space    Shuttle         which    was    first    reusable    spacecraft    to    be    successfully    used    .                 Mir    and    Skylab    enabled    prolonged    human    habitation    in    space    .

Its    arms    race    with    the United States    was    draining    country    of    funds         and    further    weakened    by    internal    pressures         ethnic    and    political    .    Mikhail    Gorbachev         its    last    leader         attempted    to    reform    country    with    glasnost    and    perestroika                      but    formation    of    Solidarity                      fall    of    Berlin    Wall                      and    breaking-off    of    several    Soviet    republics         such    as    Lithuania                      started    a    slippery    slope    of    events    that    culminated    in    a    coup    to    overthrow    Gorbachev         organized    by    Communist    Party    hard-liners    .    Boris    Yeltsin         president    of    Russia         organized    mass    opposition         and    coup    failed    .                 On    December                    Soviet    Union    was    officially    disbanded    into    its    constituent    republics         thus    putting    a    final    line    under    already    exhausted    Cold    War    .

Computers    became    reprogrammable    rather    than    fixed-purpose    devices    .    invention    of    programming    languages    meant    computer    operators    could    concentrate    on    problem    solving    at    a    high-level         without    having    to    think    in    terms    of    individual    instructions    to    computer    itself    .                 creation    of    operating    systems    also    vastly    improved    programming    productivity    .    Building    on    this         computer    pioneers    could    now    realize    what    they    had    envisioned    .    graphical    user    interface         piloted    by    a    computer    mouse    made    it    simple    to    harness    power    of    computer    and    made    it    more    accessible    to    new    users    .                 Storage    for    computer    programs    progressed    from    punched    cards    and    paper    tape    to    magnetic    tape         floppy    disks    and    hard    disks    .

Cost-effective    CPUs    led    to    thousands    of    industrial    and    home-brew    computer    designs         many    of    which    became    successful    ;    a    home-computer    boom    was    led    by    Apple    II         ZX80    and    Commodore    PET    .                              IBM         seeking    to    embrace    microcomputer    revolution         devised    its    IBM    Personal    Computer         PC         .    Crucially         IBM    developed    PC    from    third-party    components    that    were    available    on    open    market    .                 only    impediment    to    another    company    duplicating    system   " s"   architecture    was    proprietary    BIOS    software    .

Microsoft         which    produced    an    operating    system    for    PC         rode    this    wave    of    popularity    to    become    world   " s"   leading    software    company    .                s    heralded    Information    Age    .    rise    of    computer    applications    and    data    processing    made    ethereal    ``    information   "  "   as    valuable    as    physical    commodities    .    This    brought    about    new    concerns    surrounding    intellectual    property    issues    .    the United States    Government    made    algorithms    patentable         forming    basis    of    software    patents    .                 controversy    over    these    and    proprietary    software    led    Richard    Stallman    to    create    Free    Software    Foundation    and    begin    GNU    Project         paving    way    for    a    free    software    movement    .                 Computers    also    became    a    usable    platform    for    entertainment    .    Computer    games    were    first    developed    by    software    programmers    exercising    their    creativity    on    large    systems    at    universities         but    these    efforts    became    commercially    successful    in    arcade    games    such    as    Pong    and    Space    Invaders    .                 Once    home    computer    market    was    established         young    programmers    in    their    bedrooms    became    core    of    a    youthful    video    game    industry    .                 In    order    to    take    advantage    of    advancing    technology         games    consoles    were    created    .    Like    arcade    systems         these    machines    had    custom    hardware    designed    to    do    game-oriented    operations         such    as    sprites    and    parallax    scrolling         in    preference    to    general    purpose    computing    tasks    .                 first    model    of    IBM    PC         personal    computer    whose    successors    would    fill    world.Computer    networks    appeared    in    two    main    styles    ;    local    area    network         linking    computers    in    an    office    or    school    to    each    other         and    wide    area    network         linking    local    area    networks    together    .    Initially         computers    depended    on    telephone    networks    to    link    to    each    other         spawning    Bulletin    Board    sub-culture    .                 However         a    DARPA    project    to    create    bomb-proof    computer    networks    led    to    creation    of    Internet         a    network    of    networks    .    core    of    this    network    was    robust    TCP/IP    network    protocol    .                 Thanks    to    efforts    from    Al    Gore         Internet    grew    beyond    its    military    role    when    universities    and    commercial    businesses    were    permitted    to    connect    their    networks    to    it    .                              main    impetus    for    this    was    electronic    mail         a    far    faster    and    convenient    form    of    communication    than    a    conventional    letter    and    memo    distribution         and    File    Transfer    Protocol         FTP         .    However         Internet    remained    largely    unknown    to    general    public         who    were    used    to    Bulletin    Boards    and    services    like    Compuserve    and    the United States    Online    .    This    changed    when    Tim    Berners-Lee    devised    a    simpler    form    of    Vannevar    Bush   " s"   hypertext         which    he    dubbed    World    Wide    Web    .                 ``    Web   "  "   suddenly    changed    Internet    into    a    printing    press    beyond    geographic    boundaries    of    physical    countries    ;    it    was    termed    ``    cyberspace   "  "   .

Web   " s"   immense    success    also    fueled    commercial    use    of    Internet    .    Convenient    home    shopping    had    been    an    element    of    ``    visions    of    future   "  "   since    development    of    telephone         but    now    race    was    on    to    provide    convenient         interactive    consumerism    .                 Companies    trading    through    websites    became    known    as    ``    dot    coms   "  "        due    to    ``    .com   "  "   suffix    of    commercial    Internet    addresses    .                 change    of    century    also    lead    to    fear    and    paranoia    of    Y2K         where    it    was    hypothesized    that    World   " s"   computers    would    glitch    and    cause    havoc    on    banks         prisons         transit    systems    and    more.The    world    at    end    of    century         edit         Main    article    :   sBy    end    of    century         more    technological    advances    and    scientific    discoveries    had    been    made    than    in    all    of    preceding    history    .    Communications    and    information    technology         transportation    technology         and    medical    advances    have    radically    altered    daily    lives    .    Europe    appeared    to    be    at    a    sustainable    peace    for    first    time    in    recorded    history    .    people    of    Indian    subcontinent         a    sixth    of    world    population    at    end    of    century         had    attained    indigenous    independence    for    first    time    in    centuries    .    China         an    ancient    nation    comprising    a    fifth    of    world   " s"   population         was    finally    open    to    world    in    a    new    and    powerful    synthesis    of    West    and    East         creating    a    new    state    after    near-complete    destruction    of    old    cultural    order    .    With    end    of    colonialism    and    Cold    War         nearly    a    billion    people    in    Africa    were    left    with    truly    independent    new    nation-states         some    cut    from    whole    cloth         standing    up    after    centuries    of    foreign    domination    .                 geographic    distribution    of    surface    warming    during   st    century    calculated    by    HadCM3    climate    model    if    a    business    as    usual    scenario    is    assumed    for    economic    growth    and    greenhouse    gas    emissions    .    In    this    figure         globally    averaged    warming    corresponds    to   .0    °C        .4    °F         .The    world    was    undergoing    its    second    major    period    of    globalization    ;    first         which    started    in   th    century         having    been    terminated    by    World    War    I    .                 Since    the United States    was    in    a    position    of    almost    unchallenged    domination         a    major    part    of    process    was    the United Statesnization    .                 This    led    to    anti-Western    and    anti-the United Statesn    feelings    in    parts    of    world         especially    Middle    East    .                 influence    of    China    and    India    was    also    rising         as    world   " s"   largest    populations         long    marginalized    by    West    and    by    their    rulers         were    rapidly    integrating    with    world    economy    .                 However         several    problems    face    world    .    gap    between    rich    and    poor    nations    continued    to    widen    .    Some    said    that    this    problem    could    not    be    fixed         that    there    was    a    set    amount    of    wealth    and    it    could    only    be    shared    by    so    many    .    Others    said    that    powerful    nations    with    large    economies    were    not    doing    enough    to    help    improve    rapidly    evolving    economies    of    Third    World    .    However         developing    countries    faced    many    challenges         including    scale    of    task    to    be    surmounted         rapidly    growing    populations         and    need    to    protect    environment    and    cost    that    goes    along    with    it.Terrorism         dictatorship         and    spread    of    nuclear    weapons    were    other    issues    requiring    attention    .    world    was    still    blighted    by    small-scale    wars    and    other    violent    conflicts         fueled    by    competition    over    resources    and    ethnic    conflicts    .    Despots    such    as    Kim    Jong-il    of    North    Korea    continued    to    lead    their    nations    toward    development    of    nuclear    weapons    .                 Disease    threatened    to    destabilize    many    regions    of    world    .    New    viruses    such    as    SARS    and    West    Nile    continued    to    spread    .                              In    poor    nations         malaria    and    other    diseases    affected    majority    of    population    .    Millions    were    infected    with    HIV         virus    which    causes    AIDS    .    virus    was    becoming    an    epidemic    in    southern    Africa    .                 Perhaps    most    importantly         it    was    speculated    that    in    long    term         environmental    problems    threatened    planet   " s"   livability    .    most    serious    problem    was    global    warming         which    was    predicted    to    frequently    flood    coastal    areas         due    to    human-caused    emission    of    greenhouse    gases         particularly    carbon    dioxide    produced    by    burning    of    fossil    fuels    .    Like    threat    of    a    nuclear    world    war         shift    of    climate    change    has    since    added    to    fear    of    possibility    of    human    extinction         although    not    overnight    but    over    several    decades    .                 This    prompted    many    nations    to    negotiate    and    sign    Kyoto    treaty         which    set    mandatory    limits    on    carbon    dioxide    emissions    .                 celebration    of   th    century    ’    s    ending    expressed    popular    opinion    that    New    Year   " s"   Eve       and    New    Year   " s"   Day       marked    turn    of    millennium         while    strictly    speaking   th    century    ended    on    New    Year   " s"   Eve       and   st    century    began    on    New    Year   " s"   Day   .See    also         edit         Timeline    of   th    centuryInfectious    disease    in   th    centuryDeath    rates    in   th    centuryList    of    battles   -200020th    century    inventions20th-century    artList    of   th-century    religious    leadersModernismModern    artReferences         edit         ^    ``    Franz    Ferdinand    assassinated    in    Sarajevo    |    Century    Ireland   "  "   .    www.rte.ie    .
